                <br /><p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 7, 2014</p>

                <p>Welcome to VocaliD.  Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (including the mobile applications) related to VocaliD and its Human Voicebank Initiative (collectively, the “Services”).  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at info@vocaliD.co or write to us at 21 Drydock Ave., 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02210.</p>

                <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and VocaliD, Inc. (“VocaliD,” “we” and “us”).   You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.  Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.  These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>What do I need to know about donating my vocal content?</h2>

                <p><strong>Once you donate recordings of your vocal content, your contribution is irrevocable and it may be used by VocaliD or its affiliates for scientific research, the development of products (including those intended for speech impaired individuals) and for other purposes not yet known.  We’re excited about the science behind VocaliD’s Human Voicebank, but please note that there can be no guarantee as to any outcome from any use of your vocal content.  Donating your vocal content does not guarantee that VocaliD will use it to create a synthetic voice for another individual; however, if we do, we will always blend your recordings with other audio samples or use algorithms so that your voice will not be readily personally identifiable when used by such individual.   If you want to learn more about the process of donating your vocal content, visit http://www.vocalid.co/voicebank.</strong></p>

                <p>Please note that your voice is a multidimensional signal and reflects aspects of your personality and well-being. As science advances there may be information in your recordings related to your health and wellness, such as indicators that you have or are developing a speech and/or voice impairment. We have no obligation to notify you of the presence of any such information </p>

                <h2>Will these Terms ever change?</h2>

                <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.VocaliD.co website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. </p>

                <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

                <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us. </p>

                <h2>What about my privacy?</h2>

                <p>VocaliD takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current VocaliD Privacy Policy, please visit http://www.vocalid.co/privacy.</p>

                <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”).  Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent.  If you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process.  If you believe that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at info@vocalid.co.</p>

                <h2>What are the basics of using VocaliD?</h2>

                <p>You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“VocaliD User ID”).  You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself.  You may not select as your VocaliD User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>

                <p>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).  You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.  If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services.</p>

                <p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password.  You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>

                <p><strong>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</strong></p>

                <p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or Vocal Content (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>(a) Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including VocaliD);</li>
                    <li>(b) Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control laws;</li>
                    <li>(c) Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
                    <li>(d) Jeopardizes the security of your VocaliD account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);</li>
                    <li>(e) Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;</li>
                    <li>(f) Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;</li>
                    <li>(g) Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</li>
                    <li>(h) “Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);</li>
                    <li>(i) Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</li>
                    <li>(j) Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>

                <h2>What are my rights in VocaliD?</h2>

                <p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, Vocal Content (as defined below), and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.  You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including VocaliD’s) rights.</p>

                <p>You understand that VocaliD owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>

                <p>VocaliD, the VocaliD logos and all VocaliD product and service names including the Human Voicebank are trademarks of VocaliD.</p>  

                <h2>Do I have to grant any rights or licenses to VocaliD?</h2>

                <p>When you record vocal content using the Services or provide us with other content or information, you grant us certain rights in that content.  </p>

                <p>For all vocal content you record and upload through the Services (“Vocal Content”) and for all other content or information you provide through the Services (“Personal Content”, and collectively with Voice Content, “Submitted Content”), you hereby grant VocaliD a royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide license to perform, modify, adapt, create derivative works, reproduce, and distribute, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Submitted Content and otherwise fully utilize and exploit such Submitted Content, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below, and always subject to our Privacy Policy located at http://www.VocaliD.com/privacy.  The rights you grant will remain in effect even if you stop using the Services or terminate these Terms or your account. </p>

                <p>You grant the above rights notwithstanding any rights of publicity, privacy or otherwise (whether or not statutory) anywhere in the world and expressly authorize VocaliD (and its agents, consultants, and employees) to: (i) record, tape, and otherwise record you and your voice, (ii) use your voice and likeness, in connection with its business, products and services and to allow others to do the same and (iii) use, reproduce, disseminate, alter, edit, dub, modify, distort, add to, subtract from, and otherwise exploit your Vocal Content or derivatives or extensions or imitations thereof in any manner that VocaliD sees fit, in any medium or technology now known or hereinafter invented in perpetuity.  Without limiting the scope of any license or release you grant to VocaliD, you acknowledge and agree that VocaliD may combine your Vocal Content with the content of other individuals to create one or more “synthetic voices” and the results of that combination may be used by others to facilitate their public and private communications.  YOU RELEASE VOCALID, ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSEES AND ASSIGNS AND ALL ENTITIES ASSOCIATED WITH VOCALID AND AGREE NOT TO SUE OR BRING ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY OF THE SAME FOR, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, FOR DEFAMATION, LIABLE, SLANDER, INVASION OF RIGHT OF PRIVACY, PUBLICITY OR PERSONALITY OR ANY SIMILAR MATTER BASED UPON OR RELATING TO THE EXERCISE OF ANY OF THE RIGHTS REFERRED TO HEREIN.</p>

                <h2>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h2>

                <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.  You will keep all your registration information accurate and current.  You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>

                <p>If there is a dispute between users on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that VocaliD is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release VocaliD, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>

                <h2>Will VocaliD ever change the Services?</h2>

                <p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.  We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.  We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. </p>

                <h2>What if I want to stop using VocaliD?</h2>

                <p>You’re free to stop using VocaliD and its products and services at any time, by contacting us at info@vocaliD.co; please refer to our Privacy Policy at http://www.VocaliD.co/privacy as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.  </p>

                <p>VocaliD is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. VocaliD has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms. Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. </p>

                <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.  By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>

                <h2>If I use the VocaliD Human Voicebank App available via the Apple App Store or on Google play, what do I need to know?</h2>

                <p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the iOS and Android  applications available via the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store (the “Application”) or via the Google, Inc. (“Google”) Google Play store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>(a) Both you and VocaliD acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and VocaliD only, and not with Apple or Google and that Apple and/or Google are not responsible for the Application or the Content;</li>
                    <li>(b) The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;</li>
                    <li>(c) You will only use the Application in connection with a device that you own or control;</li>
                    <li>(d) You acknowledge and agree that Apple and/or Google has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;
                    <li>(e) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple and/or Google of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s and/or Google’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;</li>
                    <li>(f) You acknowledge and agree that VocaliD, and not Apple and/or Google, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;</li>
                    <li>(g) You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, VocaliD, and not Apple and/or Google, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</li>
                    <li>(h) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</li>
                    <li>(i) Both you and VocaliD acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and</li>
                    <li>(j) Both you and VocaliD acknowledge and agree that Apple, Apple’s subsidiaries, Google and Google’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple and/or Google will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What else do I need to know?</h2>

                <p><strong>Warranty Disclaimer.</strong>  Neither VocaliD nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.  We (and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Services.  THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY VOCALID (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </p>

                <p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL VOCALID (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO VOCALID IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </p>

                <p><strong>Indemnity.</strong>  To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold VocaliD, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.  </p>

                <p><strong>Assignment.</strong>  You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without VocaliD’s prior written consent.  We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>

                <p><strong>Choice of Law; Arbitration.</strong>  These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.  Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. <strong>Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VOCALID ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></p>
