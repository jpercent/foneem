                <br /><p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 7, 2014</p>

                <p>We at VocaliD know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.  <strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong></p>

                <p>Remember that your use of VocaliD’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy and is available at www.vocalid.co/terms.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

                <h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2>

                <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>

                <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”).  Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent.  If you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process.  If you believe that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at info@vocalid.co.  We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Information from a child under 13 than is reasonably necessary for that participation, and we do not retain Personal Information from children under 13 longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.</p>

                <h2>Will VocaliD ever change this Privacy Policy?</h2>

                <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the vocalid.co website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.</p>

                <h2>What Information does VocaliD Collect?</h2>

                <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p>

                <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name and email address.  Certain information other than Personal Information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features, such as your city and state, places you have lived in the past, your age, gender, languages spoken, height, and descriptions of your own vocal characteristics (such as tone, pitch, accent, etc.).</p>

                <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may email you about your use of the Services.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by contacting us at info@vocalid.co.</p>

                <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>

                <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>

                <p>If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.  Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>

                <p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.  We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>

                <p><strong>Will VocaliD Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</strong></p>

                <p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties only in limited circumstances as described below:</p>

                <p><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies, research organizations and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

                <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.  Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

                <p><strong>Protection of VocaliD and Others:</strong> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use (available at www.vocalid.co/terms) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of VocaliD, our employees, our users, or others.</p>

                <h2>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h2>

                <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

                <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

                <h2>What Personal Information can I access?</h2>

                <p>The information you can view, update, and delete through your account settings may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at info@vocalid.co.</p>

                <p>If you are a parent or guardian of a user of our Services who is under 13, you may contact us at any time to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Information from such user, and (b) we delete any Personal Information already collected from such user.  Please note that the terms regarding deleted data outlined below in “What choices do I have?” also apply to deleted Personal Information from children under 13.</p>

                <p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to info@vocalid.co.</p>

                <h2>What choices do I have?</h2>

                <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to use the Services.</p>

                <p>Keep in mind that your information may remain in our records after you uninstall our application or otherwise delete or abandon your account.</p>

                <h2>What if I have questions about this policy?</h2>

                <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to info@vocalid.co, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
