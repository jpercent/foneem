                <h2>How do you create custom synthetic voices?</h2>
                <p>The creation of a custom vocal persona is a two-part process which involves the recording and blending of voices. We leverage the power of social collaboration to gather recordings from speech donors who are passionate about giving the gift of voice. Using our cutting-edge voice blending technology, we craft a vocal identity that is both authentic and understandable.</p>

                <h2>Just what is this “cutting-edge technology” that blends the voices?</h2>
                <p>This work began as a means to provide unique voices for those who rely on computerized devices because they are unable to speak. Our patent pending technology builds on speech science theory to combine the recipient's voice characteristics with a database of speech recordings from a matched donor. The result is a hybrid voice that preserves the clarity of the donor’s recordings but conveys as much of the recipient’s vocal identity as possible.</p>

            <p>Rupal founded VocaliD to give the gift of voice to all those who need and want a voice of their own. Her training as a speech clinician and scientist led to her initial insight to combine the vocalizations of recipients with the speech of healthy donors. After years of research and experimentation, she is now committed to bringing this innovation to market and in doing so re-envisioning speech prostheses as custom crafted enhancements that make communication more human.</p>
            <p>Rupal is a tenured professor at Northeastern University with joint appointments in Communication Science and Disorders and Computer Science as well as numerous adjunct and affiliated appointments at Harvard, MIT, University of Massachusetts and Yale University. She founded and directs the Communication Analysis and Design Laboratory and the Center for Speech Science and Technology. A native of Canada, Rupal received her BS from University of Calgary and her Masters and Ph.D from the University of Toronto. She then completed her post-doctoral studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she worked with Professor Kenneth Stevens, a pre-eminent speech scientist. Rupal worked as a speech clinician prior to her doctoral studies which is where she became fascinated by the application of speech technologies to those with communication disorders. Patel has over 50 peer reviewed publications in the areas of speech motor control and assistive communication technology and has raised over $5 million in research funding through the National Science Foundation, various institutes within NIH (NIDCD, NICHD, NIBIB), and private foundations.</p>

            <p>Geoff has deep expertise in speech signal processing and a passion for designing speech technologies that reimagine new ways to communicate. He has developed speech prostheses for alaryngeal speakers and recently led a multimillion dollar, interdisciplinary effort to build the first-ever mobile silent speech recognition system. Given his background in speech modification and experience managing large scale engineering efforts, he will help scale VocaliD’s personalized synthesis efforts.</p>
            <p>Geoff is the Section Lead of the Biological, Audio, and Speech Signal group at BAE Systems.  He received his B.S. in engineering from Harvey Mudd College, his S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT and his Ph.D. in Speech and Hearing Biosciences and Technology also from MIT. His graduate work, co-supervised by Professor Kenneth Stevens and Robert Hillman, focused on improving the quality of alaryngeal speech. He has over 15 years of industry and research experience in speech processing, speech coding, and biological signal processing.  During the course of his career, Geoff has won, led, and managed multiple multi-million dollar DARPA efforts to develop technologies ranging from gait-based biometrics, to brain control of prosthetic arms, and most notably a practical portable silent-speech recognition system that can be used to improve the communication of people with severe speech disorders.</p>
