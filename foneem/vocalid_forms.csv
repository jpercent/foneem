They are a non profit org. that has broadcasting and recording studios across Canada. They provide audio recordings or newspapers and magazines for people with vision impairments. They have a very large contingent of volunteers who are professionally coached to record their voices for broadcast! They would be an excellent source of recording studios and quite possibly donor voices. Their website is http://www.ami.ca/.

I just learned about your brilliant, life-changing work on TED Talks.

While an undergraduate, I had a part-time job as a "reader" and spent many hours recording reading assignments for a graduate student with a visual impairment. (I was paid from grant money by a private foundation.)

I am nearing age 60 now and would be honored to volunteer my voice in such a meaningful way. I will be telling others about your work!

Thank-you,

Just got an idea (in case you have not thought of this yet) -- there could be "Voice Drives" held at schools, churches, and ...... 
 
Curious -- do you record a voice singing? I imagine what it would be like if a person with a vocal impairment could sing "Happy Birthday" or a Christmas Carol.

3769;Sean Nowak;snowak@dibomedia.de;;Dear Team,

I saw the TED talk and was very impressed. I think what is missing on your site is information about the recording part besides the fact that the goal is to get so much time's worth of recorded speech. What about the whole *process*? Do you expect people to own advanced equipment and simply sit at their computers at home and load up recordings? Or do you require people to spend money and time adjourning to a studio, and where might that be? Is there a casting process? How much preparation time is needed on the side of the contributor before the recording can actually take place? What kind of voice is most needed? And what about languages? I suspect that not providing that information on your site will somewhat stifle motivation.

No need to answer this individually. I will come back to your site and see.

My daughter and I would be interested in doing the voice donation when it is possible to do it from home. 
I am a 43 yr old male and my daughter is a 10 yr old female. My daughter also indicated that she would try to record new versions of her voice over time. This may provide someone who is currently a similar age to her with updated voiceprints over teen and then adult years.
Note that we are in Australia, so voices will have Australian accents. :-)

I thought at the time back then that if I could not find a placement as a pastor I would go into teaching speech.

 I am interested in being a voice donor or helping in anyway needed. My daughter would also be glad to help...clear, sweet, voice. I am 48 and my daughter is almost 18. Although we are not native Texans we have a bit of dialect now, however, we could work on articulation!!!! The thought occurred it would be a wonderful multigenerational project because, as we age, our voices change. My daughter and I have almost identical sounding voices...I realize this is not always true! however, screening would identify if voices could be linked to provide consumers with different voices as they age??? Also, I am at a very, "service minded" school. I have a student, age 6, who can read anything...although he is an anomaly, we do have a lot of young readers who could, over time, created voice bank contributions. Imagine a Kindergarten boy actually having a Kindergarten boy voice!!! My thought is that you could also get voices from young children who are good at repeating things. Even echolalic students could contribute. If I was a parent of a child with autism it would please me immensely to be able to help another child with a disability. What an exciting and LONG overdue adventure you are embarking upon! I am so thankful and so willing to serve in anyway possible.

I've written a Microsoft ThinkWeek paper on a topic that parallels your speech synthesis, but does so for an audience of 6 billion people. I believe greater value like this will also bring you much more interest and investment. Please contact me and we'll continue this conversation.

I'm a native German speaker, so I'm not sure to which extent my voice would be useful! My English is quite good! And also, in case you ever want to expand into other languages, maybe you can build up a foreign language database! 

I'm an experienced localizer and work in the game development industry as a kind of producer, frequently for localization and VO, so if localization is a direction you guys are planning to take, in that case I might also be able to contribute or like to get involved from the developer side.

I have just watched your TED talk recorded in December 2013 and it have profoundly moved me to take action and become involved. I am 42 year old English Man living in North London, England. I have a deep voice with a southern english accent and I am keen to become a donor.

Your cause is also a very worthy one and i would like to explore the possibility of working with you to help raise funds and establish/consolidate your presence in the UK. I have a degree in Business Studies and have 20 years in corporate sales in IT, software and telecommunications industries. For 5 years I have run my own business with the objective of working with people genuinely care about the product or service. 

I have been seeking a product that will make a difference to peoples lives, you have conceived a fantastic way to change the lives of many with a gift most take for granted. 

Let me know if I can be of assistance working with developing a presence in the UK.

3898;mark;ymarkone@hmamail.com;;Why delay your continuing work waiting for a website to be developed? Definitely a good idea to have a website for those "point and clickers" out there, but you can start now without the website!

All you need to do is create a PDF file (very simple to do) that contains the requirements you have for the recorded sound file (mp3, 44,100 Hz, 128 kbps, etc) and a list of the sentences you need to have read.

People who already have software on their computers can set the specific requirements in the software and then start recording the sentences. If you break down the list into "chapters" that will allow a person to record a little bit at a time and finish the list in 10-20 days then it will not seem such a chore. Almost anyone can find 15 minutes a day to help someone else have their own voice.

Then they can send you the recordings of each session as they finish. None of this needs anything more than your current website, a downloadable PDF file, and a method of sending you the recordings (e-mail, file sharing, etc)

In this way you can start getting new voices even before you get the funding for a website and further work. This will allow you to hopefully have a backlog of voices to work on, once you get your funding.;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I've used TTS technologies before--some even in my musical/artistic creations.

I also have been running an open language project called "World Phrasebook":
http://worldphrasebook.net/

which is basically a Google spreadsheet that simply started out with 1000+ *useful* English phrases that I personally jotted down on a notepad from day to day, which has grown into translations of these phrases into tens of different languages around the world. If these phrases can be of any use to your team, then please take a look. (This isn't self-promotion since I don't make any money off of the project; I just mention it in case it might have any relevance to your project.)

I saw your TedWomen talk and was completely inspired. I'd love to help. At minimum, I'm happy to be a voice donor. But I wonder if there's an opportunity for a deeper collaboration in one of the other areas you need help with: I'm currently a voice user interface designer with Nuance Communications, a software company with a large presence in both speech recognition and TTS production. In my prior life, I was an academic with a focus on the perception of phonetic variation. I'm based in NYC but will likely be up in Cambridge sometime over the next month or so (we have an office there) - if you're interested, I'd love to chat with you / your team while I'm in town.

I am deeply interested in helping to launch a voice drive, especially here on the UCLA campus. As aforementioned, I am a musician and have digital audio processing experience. I have no qualms about using my own equipment as well as motivating and involving my peers who also do recording. If I can rally enough support, a studio setting may be possible, and quality donations would be certain.

Katrin Lemler, die Tochter von Freunden, ist selbst sprachunfÃ¤hig und hat mir mittels eines Talkers von Ihrem Aufruf einer Stimmenspende fÃ¼r andere Talker erzÃ¤hlt.
Ich wÃ¼rde meine Stimme gerne zur VerfÃ¼gung stellen, falls Sie eine Stimme fÃ¼r Deutsch benÃ¶tigen.

Ich arbeite seit knapp 10 Jahren in einem Museum und biete dort FÃ¼hrungen an, wodurch ich also gewohnt bin, deutlich zu sprechen. Zudem spielte ich als Student mehrere Jahre Theater und habe vor einigen Jahren fÃ¼r einen Film den ErzÃ¤hler gesprochen.

Falls Sie Interesse an meiner Stimmenspende haben, setzen Sie sich bitte mit mir in Verbindung.

4105;Kate Larsen;katelarsen@gmail.com;805-231-7823;I heard a Ted Talk on this tonight, and found it fascinating and so important. I am a retired middle school teacher and now substitute a lot, and know how important this would be to young children and teens. We lost our middle child to cancer, so I understand kids suffering. We have an eight year old grandson who has significant developmental delays. Also, about twenty-five years ago, I contracted encephalitis and lost my ability to speak, sounding as if I had suffered a stroke. It took a long time to recover. I'm only telling you this to explain that I have empathy for kids and adults with problems. Teaching taught me to project, and my English teacher Mom taught me to enunciate well. I'd love to be considered.

4115;Drago Flores;dflores@alumni.nd.edu;090-2825-3105;I heard about this project on the NPR: TED Radio Hour Podcast. 

It was so WONDERFUL to hear people have a voice that matched their own! ^-^ I listen to TED talks and talks on The Moth all the time but I was so moved by the story by Rupal Patel that I ...I cried! It was amazing! I want to give my voice ...or rather, I want others to be able to express themselves in a voice that sounds more like them. 

I love to sing. To me, my voice is everything and a life without my voice would be so very inhibiting to my character and my being. I hope that I can help someone find their character and their being and if that happens to be through my voice then I could not be happier.

4116;Anne Alexander Sieder;annesieder@googlemail.com;+491716766461;Hello, I recently heard about your project on TED and was immediately fascinated. I'm actually a trained actor and a large part of my income comes from doing voice overs. I do everything from cartoons, video games, commercials, documentaries, industrial films, audio books, e-learning... Obviously, because of my work, I'm critically aware of the importance of having your own voice and being able to express yourself in a way that makes others relate to you as a "full" person. 

I would be willing to donate my voice and also, if needed, direct others so that the words and phrases sound natural instead of "read". I'm sure I could convince many of my colleagues to donate as well. I'm an expat American living in Germany and the acting world is pretty small here - even smaller for English speaking actors. Though, my circle of friends is not limited to the English speaking world. Almost all of the German actors speak English as well - albeit with an accent, but that could be useful for someone who has to travel and still wants to be able to communicate using "their own" voice.

I think your project is absolutely wonderful and would love to help in any way I can.

Best,

4120;Lola Piscopo;lalolapi@gmail.com;6178209956;Hi there, I am a 29 year old special education teacher from Massachusetts. I work with students who have an array of moderate to severe cognitive, physical, and communication impairments. A good number of my students use AAC to communicate, and a large amount of the technology we use for instruction uses "computer generated" voices. I think that the idea of personalizing device voices is amazing and complex, but also so simple in it's goal: to give people independence and self identity. One of the stories that sticks out in my mind from my years of teaching is when we were listing to a book using a text to speech converter. One of my verbal students raised his hand and said "Ms. Piscopo, why is Kayla reading that book?" Kayla is one of his classmates who uses a communication device. I suddenly realized how much importance we all put on voices when interpreting the world around us. I would love to help spread awareness of this project, and donate my voice.

 Currently, in my professional capacity, I work for a non-profit in Portland, Oregon that provides a variety of professional services to 12 local organizations. Since my day can vary significantly, these means there may be a variety of ways I could help support your organization: coordinating & developing content for a board retreat or training, fiscal systems & management, event planning, fundraising, grantwriting, writing bylaws, organizational development, contract management, outreach & messaging. If you have more specifics of what you need, please let me know -- I would love to volunteer. Also, in Portland we have a community radio station where I have just begun to volunteer. Perhaps connections with community and public radio stations would be an easy way to help boost your organization -- one for outreach and the second for actually collecting voice samples through a voice drive.

I would also wonder if you'd thought of reaching out to recording studios, sound engineers, or producers who may be able to donate time in their recording booth for the time being while apps or privately accessible devices are being developed. I'd once recorded guided imagery in a recording studio and imagine these booths can be found throughout the country, and some of the professionals who run them may want to support your project, as they make their living in sound and self-expression.

4302;THOMAS GRAHAM;thomaswgraham@gmail.com;202.684.8079;I listened to the TED talk about the little girl who was given a voice and like I'm sure anyone else who heard it, was truly inspired and touched. I'm a 44 year old man living in Washington D.C. My mother is asian and my father is caucasian. I grew up only speaking english. (However, I can do a pretty authentic imitation of my mother's accent. ;-) I'm not married and have no children (nor do I expect to before I die); but I am a very proud uncle of a niece and 2 nephews. I often think about how I won't be able to pass on any of my talents, gifts, attributes, acquired skills, or other characters of who I am through my DNA. Therefore, if I want any piece of me to live on, it is incumbent upon me to share that trait with another human being. If I can provide a voice to someone who doesn't have one, then I feel that my life goal of "giving to the world more than I take from it before I die" can be one step closer to being achieved.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

4460;Charlotte Poetschner;c.poetschner@att.net;(217) 891-7927;First, I heard about the Vocal ID program on a TED talk this evening. 
Second, the theme of the TED program was "extending senses." I listened, at first, as someone who has a disability of my own. I am totally blind. The one thing people have always said about me...from time to time...is that they enjoy listening to my speaking voice. 
Third, I memorize for public speaking purposes. Sometimes two thousand words per week. If I understood the process, the "donor" needs to read an adequate number of sentences so that all necessary "syllables" are recorded. Although I can't know for sure, I think I would be able to memorize the material. 
Finally, I get it that this is like a "voice" bank. My voice may or may not be matched with a recipient. Whatever the outcome, the opportunity to give would be a gift to me as well. I'm willing to do the work to make this happen.

Would love to contribute if you need help with business plan support or need donors who can speak Mandarin. I am fluent in both tongues and have access to a recording studio if needed. I am currently the CFO/COO of a private hospital network, based in Beijing. Let me know if I can help.

4537;Hollenstein;p-hollenstein@orange.fr;+33 (0)4 93 61 1;My husband and I are professional voice and breath trainers and experts, since nearly 15 years. We work with professional singers, upper management in businesses and every one else who is interested working on their voice. We teach executives and other business employees to speach and to transmit their messages in an effective and authentic way. We have trained voices. I personally am a trained opera singer (since over 20 years), and do professional voice recordings for the software industry and sometimes for the theater.
I am willing to donate my voice (French, English, German and ev. Dutch).
I am in my late fourties and have a soprano voice, but I can also speak in other vocal tones if necessary. My husband has a bass voice and is 60+ years old.
And if you wish me to contribute in other capacities I would be happy to consider your proposals. I live and work in the South of France (Biot) and usually do my audio recordings on a free software named Audacity.

Please contact me in case you are interested in working with us.

I am a math teacher (part time). I work three days/week. I am 61 years old, married with grown children and one grandson. I live in Capitola, California, on the coast, about 90 miles south of San Francisco. 

I was born in Illinois, but left when I was a year old. Somehow neither of my parents have a midwestern accent...nor do I. But, I love trying to recognize accents. I can often tell where a person is from, even when others don't even hear an accent. (I like doing accents, too and I'm a pretty good mimic!). I only mention all this to let you know that in addition to wanting to help, I have an interest in the human voice. I also sing in two groups...one a mixed 60 person choir (alto 2) and the other, an eight-woman ensemble (tenor). Again, if you think I can be of assistance, please contact me!

4602;Kathryn Milton;kathryn.j.milton@gmail.com;7062945825;I have formally studied Arabic from native speakers. I'm Caucasian American who has lived across the US, so my accent wavers. I'm not particularly fond of my own voice, I think it sounds too childish for a grown woman, but it is my voice. I also took French in HS and am studying Hindi. I would be utterly delighted to give someone else the ability to speak, enunciate, to express themselves with the color of the spoken word.
I have been amazed at the incorporation of punctuation in the electronic voice "Alex" by Apple in their Mac OS, and would hope that the Vocal ID program also was able to use punctuation: The full stop & breath of the period; The skip of the comma; The stop that isn't quite full of the semicolon. I don't have that kind of expertise, though.
Last year, I used Garageband on a MacBook Pro to record a novel and a half for my husband to listen to on his long drives. So, if you want a couple hours or a hundred, I'm happy to donate.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I also volunteered for 20 years as a reader for what was Recordings for the Blind and Dyslexic. (It has changed its name several times.) I served on the board of directors in the mid 90s.

Although I live in Austin, Texas and have a slight accent, I have lived overseas and traveled so I am able to tone it down or strengthen it.

I might be able to find local studios that will donate recording time, but I like to travel and am willing to fund my own trips to record in other cities or towns.

Finally, my father's only cousin had cancer of the vocal chords and used a voice box. I have been looking for another volunteer opportunity that isn't a typical activity.

I'm not sure what information is important to you. I'm a 57-year-old woman. I grew up in New York City, though with a fairly neutral North American accent. (Trained linguists can tell I'm from NY, but other people can't.) I do talk fast- a lot faster than the simulated voices I've heard on the radio. I don't know what else you'd want to know! Does the accent of the voice donor make a difference? I should think it would, since you wouldn't want your simulated voice to make your Bostonian recipient sound, say, like they come from rural Mississippi - nor like they are a recent immigrant from Pakistan.

My daughter has a pervasive developmental disability and has never been able to speak more than about 20 words. She has been learning to use a Dynavox speech generating device in recent years. My grandfather and my mother both lost their speech abilities in later life because of ALS. I would be honored to contribute to the ability of others to speak in a voice most like their own would have been. I would hope that if I ever need augmented speech, this technology would be available to me, as my husband loves the sound of my voice.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

5032;Matthew Tucker;tucktheproducer@gmail.com;(413) 346-4494;Good Evening VocalID - 

I am writing tonight, inspired by Rupal Patel's TED talk. to over my services in the future as a voice donor. While I have neither the technical nor the speech/language skills to assist you properly, and my means of financial support are limited, the most profound way I could assist is through offering my voice.

I am a 30 year old white male, barrel-chested at 250 lbs. and 5' 10". I have a fairly notable baritone voice with solid resonance and a bit of nasality. Hopefully, it can provide a strong foundation for a future speaker's voice program - I would eagerly provide 3 hours of my time to create the baseline.

As might be of help, I work at a community television station, and have access to professional recording equipment - I could, without a large expenditure of effort, provide several audio samples with different microphones and room configurations to help create the ideal baseline for your purposes.

Also, as an idea to borrow - while thinking about your project, I had an idea that might be of use to the cause. I know you are looking into producing an app that allows people to record their audio in the comfort of their own homes. However, people might have limitations as to the quietness of their environment, or in the quality of their device microphones.
To deal with this, and to act as a promotional system, you could make a "donor trailer" that could could drive from area to area. The inside of the trailer would be outfitted with a perfect studio environment (or several, depending on the size of the trailer), including soundproof foam and a professional microphone. The microphone could be connected to a computer programmed with software that will record the donor's voice. 
To get the donations, a donation coordinator would go with the trailer from region to region, and would book people to use the donation booths. The trailer could be in an area for several weeks at a time, allowing people to make several appointments (maybe 30 minutes each) to collect the complete vocal donation. Once the trailer has its donations, it would travel again to the next major city and start anew - or, it could be part of a fleet that covers regions, going to conventions and whatnot to get as many voice donations as possible.

Anymatter, I hope all of this, and at the very least my voice, can be of use. Please let me know how I can be of assistance in the future. I thank you for your time, and I look forward to working with you soon!

5131;Morgan Vondrak;Argiadesigns@gmail.com;;Hello,

I heard a bit of Dr. Patel's TED talk on TED Radio Hour Podcast and I would love
to become a voice donor. The broadcast was very touching and made me realize how we really do take for granted our abilities to speak, see, hear, touch, walk...all of these. What you are doing is wonderful.

I live in San Diego, CA and am a 32 year old, English speaking female. I would love to learn more about how to help.

Thank you,

I'm a librarian for children and have had the joy of working with sign language interpreters at one particular school a few years ago. Many classes were peppered with (or only for) speech disabled and signing children and their instructors. They were often very vocal! I'd love to know that their own voices may be coming soon!

5147;Paul Furnas;pauljfurnas@msn.com;9704431383;Hello VocalID, My name is Paul Furnas, and i heard about your organization, and what it aims to accomplish, and all I can say is it left me speechless, and yet so determined to help those unfortunate enough to be speechless. I heard about this organization through the NPR T.E.D Radio Hour Podcast I listen to frequently at the Nursery/Greenhouse i work at. The episode released just yesterday (3/7/14) featured Rupal Patel's T.E.D talk, and this organizations amazing initiative to give those with speech impairing disabilities part of their identities back through their own unique voices. 

This story, this idea, moved me to choking back tears, while walking amongst my peers, because this story hit home for me. You see, my father was diagnosed with ALS for as long as i could remember through my childhood. Infact I don't remember much of my father outside of his condition with ALS. The TED talk i listened to with the example of the 13 year old girl, Shannon with a custom voice, that she commented "(i) Totally love it," brought back waves and waves of emotion of remembering my fathers "Stephen Hawking like voice." And with that, its brought all of my dreams back of wanting to hear my fathers real voice, and not just a patchy MS Sam voice. What this organization aims to accomplish will not only be outstanding for the people with disabled voices, but also for their families, where the longing to hear the sound of a family member's voice can be recognized, and distinguished as their own. 

Ever since my father passed away, i always wished i had done more to help him in the relatively short time i knew him, but i was too young to know any better, or what i could do to help. But now that i am older, I can act, and i want to help other people with speech disabilities. I feel like the disabled have too long been overlooked, and just sent to care housing and almost forgot about, and i dream of a world where these disabled people are not overlooked because of their disabilities and can function in a world tailored to regular people. Please take my voice and help give someone back theirs, so that they may stand out and be recognized as the unique person they are underneath their disability. 

And please let me know if there is anything else i can do to help. I have a strong urge to help this organization help other people. 

Sincerly--

5183;Bridget Simpson;bmmsimpson@mac.com;518-585-7995;Greetings,
Astonishing TED talk by Dr. Patel! When I taught an aqua exercise class for people with MS, it was so liberating for otherwise chair bound people to walk. Doing what people do is liberating, whether that is walking, standing, talking, hearing. . . 

I would love to learn more about being a voice donor. I am from NY state, and have a fairly low key accent. I was an English major in college, and got my MBA in Health Services Management because we need to be creative regarding health care-- and I'm sure you consider voice a part of that. Wellness counts. 

Have you approached music schools or other arts schools for recording space? At least for people in their area. Could be a good internship or training component for them, and help you. Are you marketing your organization to voice based industries? There are some powerhouses out there. Can you imagine Julie Andrews being on board? Her voice issues allowed her to use her own voice, with some alteration, but I am sure she can relate to the importance of voice in life. Dolly Parton comes to mind. Her huge heart built her own career, then Dollywood, to pull her community forward. She promotes literacy in her father's honor, and that is words. She sings them, she encourages people to read them, and I would think she would support anyone letting anyone voice words. You might even get her to donate-- hillbillies need voices, too!! Your site indicates that the voice recipient will "flavor" the words. 

Random thoughts, off the cuff, but hopefully of some use. 

I'm giving you my work phone number, and email, but feel free to check me out on LinkedIn, to see if there is anything which you feel might serve you well. 

Thank you,

I oversee a program for approximately 70 young actors in their 20's each summer, at Williamstown Theatre Festival. - wtfestival.org I am interested in setting up a system at the Festival whereby any actors (or stagecrew or other artists) who wish to can be voice donors. Since we have a sound department as part of the Festival, it's conceivable that they could help arrange an optimal recording location/set-up. I would need to consult with my colleagues first, or course. But Is this something you would be interested in working with me to set up?

5312;Ivey Glendon;ivey.glendon@gmail.com;757-621-0188;Hello, I listened with interest yesterday (3/8/14) to the NPR/TedTalk feature on VocaliD and have two possible contributions:

(1) I would of course be willing to record a few hours of speech.

(2) I currently work as a Metadata Librarian and am fascinated about the metadata and controlled vocabulary possibilities for the project - that is, if one does not already exist, developing a set of terms to describe voice properties (raspy, throaty, breathy, etc) for consistent application to voice clips. Additionally, I would be curious about assigning metadata to donor contributions (donor's place of birth, regional influences, etc) in order to properly match voice characteristics to a voice recipient.

Do let me know if I can contribute, and good luck with the project!

5318;Elaine Washburn Shiber;ewshiber@yahoo.com;606-226-7529;I heard one of the project leaders describe your program (NPR, 3/08/14) and was fascinated by the prospect of giving samples of my voice to someone who needs one. My husband is an educator here in eastern KY and had many students who are intellectually bright but never had, or have lost their ability to speak due to tragic accidents. As a former singer, I understand how intimately important the gift of having a voice of one's own is. Despite living in KY, however, I don't have the accent. I was brought up in MA, but even that accent is not full, due mainly to theater/vocal training. If you need such a voice of a woman in her 60s, I will be most happy to contribute. Just let me know. Also, FYI: on your homepage I could not access the sound examples you provided. This may be a glitch in my computer, but it seems more likely to be on your side. Thanks for doing what you are doing, and I hope I can help in some way.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

5391;Evelyn GIgiras Sullivan;evigigs@hotmail.com;7863073642;I was listening to TedRadio on NPR Saturday, March 8, 2014 and was mesmerized and moved by Professor Rupal Patel's work and inspirations. I work for the Guardian ad Litem Program, public/ private partnership child advocacy program that connects volunteers with abused children in foster care. We ask our volunteers to become a VOICE for the child who would otherwise be lost. While ours are different realms, the motivation of every individual, to have their own "voice", a say in their destiny - their own identity, is a powerful drive for all of us.... I would be honored to participate in this project. 

I am 47-years old, born in Brazil but raised in New York City from the age of 4. While Portuguese was my first language, there are little if no hints of this origin; I actually sound quite "American". My passion growing up were movies and classic films - loved the different accents and colloquial language that allowed me a peak into different culture and times. I was always a fairly quiet child, younger of 2 girls - never really felt heard or acknowledged at home; but always chatty, overly gregarious, (in retrospect) to the point of being obnoxious at times, when sharing stories, ideas, experiences with friends - even to today. You can easily get 2-3 hours of me!

5487;Frank Rehor;frehor@mindspring.com;631 324 6213;Hello,
I just heard about your project while listening to 'The TED Radio Hour' on my local PBS station and am fascinated by what you are doing. I am a 63 year old male who, for 4 decades, worked as a system's analyst in the corporate IT environment, so have an interest in the advancement of new technologies. Looking to tap into another aspect of my personality I went back to school at age 58 and now work in the Occupational Therapy arena. In my short time in this field I have worked with, or around, both children and adults with speech issues, so can appreciate what hearing their 'own' voice would mean to them. Being able to contribute in this small way as a voice donor would be both personally and professionally rewarding. 
I look forward to participating in your project.

Sincerely,

5542;Valentine Baran;valentinexbaran@gmail.com;+33663052942;Hi!

Would you be interested in having a French language voice donor? 

I just discovered your organization through TED and was really moved by your project and research. What a beautiful and helpful initiative! 

I myself had vocal cord surgery last year, at 25 years old, after 10 years of nodules and polyps (I'm a singer). From my 14 years old to my 24 years old, my voice was constantly raspy and hoarse, very low, and I would lose it all the time. I thought that voice was "my voice". Until we found the polyps and nodules. The day of the surgery, I knew I was going to leave behind the voice that became mine, but wasn't, only to discover my actual voice. 
The first time I spoke after surgery was a big emotion! A milestone. It was the first day of the rest of my life. I will never forget that sound that came out of me, that wasn't hoarse, or raspy, that was completely new to me :)

I'm only a singer, and that was not a big speech impairment. But in my own small way, discovering "MY voice" after years, changed my life! So I can not even imagine how magical it can feel for someone that had not had the chance to speak, ever. Or someone that can't speak anymore. 

I would really love to help, in any way. My voice is no longer raspy, plus I did a lot of voice rehabilitation and have a good speaking technique (I think). Also, I have a home studio, equipped with recording devices and softwares such as Pro Tools etc.

Let me know if I can help! (I'm fluent in English but I have a French accent, so I assume that would not workâ€¦)

Best,

I am also wondering if you would be ready to accept a lot of donors. I am a member of Sweet Adelines International, a 23,000-member worldwide organization of women who love and perform the unique American art form of barbershop - 4-part a cappella harmony (think barbershop quartet...and we have both quartets and whole choruses who sing the same 4-part style. It strikes me that who better to donate voices than those who sing? I would love to let my own chorus and our international organization know about your work AND post a link to your website to our barbershop listserver so that interested women might consider contributing in some way. Choruses (chapters) range in size from 15-20 women up to more than 150, and there are more than 500 choruses in the U.S. and 14 other countries. I would be willng to bet that a lot of women in our organization would want to contribute.

If you're not aware of Sweet Adelines, here's a link to my chorus' website, and one to the international organization's website to learn more:
www.uccsai.com (Upper Cheseapeake Chorus; we are the 2011 and 2013 Mid-Atlantic Region champion chorus, and will represent our region at the November 2014 international competition in Baltimore)
Sweet Adelines International website: www.sweetadelineintl.org

Once you let me know that you'd be willing, I'll post information about your work and website and contact our international organization. We have our own education foundation that focuses on music and scholarship for young people and schools, so I'm not sure any kind of official "blessing" would take place; however, I think it's something our leadership should know about!

5726;Denis Shlosman;dshlosman@gmail.com;6178187231;I heard about this project on the TED radio hour on npr and find it fascinating and fantastic. I would love to be a part of this life-changing experience for those who are vocally impaired. I have had my own struggle with speech in that I am a stutterer. My stuttering has been relatively minor throughout my life for the most part. Now that I am in my mid 20's my speech is much better, although I do have intermittent periods where I stutter more. I feel that participating in such a project would not only be a great donation experience, but also would be helpful in improving my own speech. Recording various phrases for a long period of time would provide good speech practice and could improve my confidence in saying certain sound combinations while also giving a voice to those without one.

I was a voice performance major in college for several years, and while I don't sing like I used to, I still have an appreciation for voice and I feel drawn to help in any way I can. I'd love to be voice donor, and if there's anything else I can do to help in any way, I'd happily do that as well. Stuffing envelopes, helping with media and PR...

I am blessed to be the mother of 5 grown children and the grandmother of a very talkative 2 year old granddaughter. I absolutely agree that every person needs their own voice and one that grows with them. I always say that hearing my children's voice in video/audio recordings, touches my heart. Too often we forget that their voice grows as they mature and this should be afforded to everyone regardless of the technology needed to produce one for their use.

When I heard your story, I realized that becoming a voice donor would be an amazing opportunity for another person like my son that doesnt have a typical voice, to speak in a voice of their own.

5859;Scott Steinberg;ssteinberg@thecambridgegroup.com;612-802-2466;I just listened to Ms. Patel speak on the TED Radio Hour and was greatly inspired. The message of how important it is for everyone to have their own voice deeply resonated with me. When I was a child, I had a speech impediment and worked with speech pathologists for almost 6 years. As a result, I know how important it is for someone to be able to sound the way that they want to.

I believe I would be able to help this cause in a variety of ways. First, I would be honored to donate my voice (if possible) as well as provide some financial support. Moreover, depending on exactly what the organization's needs are, I may be able to help in planning or fund raising. Though I do not have many years of business experience (I'm 24), I have been working as an analyst for a Management Consulting firm that specializes in growth strategy for almost 2 years. In addition to general business experience, I have hard skills in Microsoft Excel and several of the major statistical software. If you believe that my experience or skills could benefit your organization at all, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I am a dentist with a very busy office. A lot of times I give my patients courtesy discounts off our prices, and I am thinking one way to raise a continuous stream of funds for you would be to ask whether they'd like to donate a portion of their discount to your organization. 

I am in South Orange County, and I would be happy to be the primary POC, at least locally, for this type of voice drive. 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity;Voice Donor Financial Other;1;0;0;1;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

5973;Bernice Black;purplehooplady@yahoo.com;734-326-6628;Currently I have fun changing my voice when I read to my grandkids or do activities with seniors. I have always felt my voice was a tool that I could use. In the past I sang in my church choir for over nine years. I was the soloist at my daughters wedding in 1998. I have always had a notion to do voices for audio books and, now retired, want to see where that might go. My grandson (now 14) was born with a cleft palate who went through several years of speech therapy. Because of that my daughter became a SLP and currently works in a local school system. I would really appreciate being considered for your program. Regards, Bonnie Black;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

6058;Sami;samantha.wertz@my.lr.edu;;I heard the TED talk and was intrigued. As a student and pastoral intern, I do not have a lot of money, but I think my voice is something I might be able to give to make a difference in someone's life. My job requires that I speak publicly several times each week and I consistently receive positive feedback that I have a pleasant and voice that is nice to listen to. Listening to the talk, I thought it might be helpful for you to know that I am a woman in my 20s and I am from Northeastern Pennsylvania (in case you'd like to identify an accent).

6061;Tina Kim-Davila;suyoung_77@yahoo.com;510-427-3997;Hello,

I was listening to Professor Rupal Patel on NPR last night I was so inspired and impressed. What a wonderful gift you're able to give to millions of those who are speech impaired. When the host of the show said we could be a voice donor I was immediately interested and hope that I can help.

Just to give a little background about myself:

Female
5'2"
Generally around 116 lbs
Asian 
In my 30's

Having only been exposed to Stephen Hawking-type computerized voices, I really feel this is amazing what your organization is doing to give individuals "their own voice". 

Best,

Also, I'd bet just about every city in the US has tech savvy kids with bands, who also have excellent sound recording equipment. Since they probably all sing (or try to!), they would probably have a particle of emphathy for your recipients, and may be more than willing to assist on the donor's end. Just a thought...

This is a huge community, literally thousands of individuals who are professional or aspiring narrators. These people could be an invaluable resource, both for voices but possibly more-so because most every one has a recording set-up, many times portable! Every narrator has free time and I can imagine every one would like the opportunity to use their ability for the benefit of others (and the publicity isn't bad either). I would love to talk with someone about this idea and how it might be implemented and taken advantage of.

The 13 year old girl who was interviewed by Guy Raz was a delight to listen to, and I would love to be able to help other women find and use their own voices, too.

All my life I've worked at helping other people because I believe it is the right thing to do, and it's always been so rewarding to me. In college, I worked at the Disabled Student Services Center helping my fellow college students who had physical needs. For 12 years, I was a support assistant for a blind state analyst who went on to become a bureau chief and was also an associate professor at a community college. Now I volunteer at my local SPCA shelter and my teenage children work there right alongside me. I'm hoping to show them how wonderful and exciting a life of helping others can be!

I'm a French-Canadian woman, 56 years old, living in Montreal, Quebec, CANADA. I've been exercising my passion for over 15 years as an English-French & French-English simultaneous interpreter and a small business owner. I found "my own voice" when I discovered I could channel all the knowledge learned in 20 years of marketing communications, bilingual education and business into recreating words from one language to another seamlessly and impeccably for the benefit of others, thereby bridging a gap. 

I've been told that I have a strong voice which sounds confident and pleasant. I've also been told that my voice has a different "personality" when I speak English vs. when I speak French... not in terms of an accent, but rather the tone and texture.

The reason I'd like to participate and donate my voice is that while I listened to the TED podcast, it struck me that helping French Canadians who don't have a voice suddenly became a possibility. How great it would be to contribute in opening up THEIR world. I'd be so honoured to take part in this opportunity.

What kind of controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the donor's banked voice?
How easy or hard would it be to reverse engineer the final product to remove the recipient's piece of the new voice to get the original donor voice?;Other;0;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

6374;Tris Ozark;tris.ozark@icloud.com;412-241-3858;Hi. I heard about you on the TED program on NPR this past weekend, and found the concept fascinating and the stories truly touching. I would love to donate my voice if it's appropriate. I'm 61, female, and live in Pittsburgh, PA, but I'm willing to travel if need be to record my voice for your use and to bank it for myself. I'm told I sound younger than I am, but I'm also told I sound just like my mother, who is 82, so my voice might be useful for a wide range of people, or for one person to use for a long time. I have benign essential tremor in my head and hands that is well controlled with medication, and so far has not affected my voice, but it might in the future so I'm hoping I can donate it soon. I wish I had money to offer, but I don't, so I'm offering my voice. I'm also offering to spread the word. Are there particular types of voices you need more than others? Is there a way I can help collect donated voices for you? For instance, I know a woman who records books for the blind. I bet she'd be willing to donate her voice for your use, and I'm thinking anyone who does that would consider donating to you as well. That program might be a goldmine for you. I'd be willing to donate some time to setting up collection sites/programs, too.
Thanks for all you do. I hope you are overwhelmed with offers as a result of that terrific radio program.

In the second grade I was old by an adult that it was "screechy" and it took me a while to become a confident speaker. Now, I think of my voice as unique rather than annoying.

I would like the chance to share my voice if that is possible. I do have some friends that have recording equipment and they may be willing to record me, and possibly others for this project.

6526;Eric Jalving;ejalving@du.edu;3038478161;Hello, I am absolutely captivated by your project. It seems to be, at once, such a profound and innovative use of modern digital recording technology, and yet it also seems so basic and obvious that it's almost hard to believe we, as a modern society, are only now coming around to realizing it! 
At any rate, I am very glad that Drs. Patel and Bunnell, et. al., are, indeed now turning this brilliant idea into a reality, and I would be both excited and honored to offer my support however possible. 

My name is Eric, and I would like to contribute my voice, my time, and perhaps even my limited expertise to the VocaliD initiative! In college at the U. of Denver, I sang in an acapella singing group and took voice lessons (alongside my study of Psychology and physical sciences) and I think that may have served to accentuate the natural resonance of my voice, even though I am only a baritone. So, while I certainly haven't studied prosody, studying sound and voices has long been a subject of great interest to me. I have a few connections with people in the local recording-studio industry here in Denver, so there is even a possibility that I could solicit their support as well!
Also, though I cannot contribute direct financial support, I have worked as a fundraiser/activist for a number of non-profit organizations, including as a professional telemarketer for over two years, so if you think I could be of any use in that regard, please let me know. Moreover, if there are other online-oriented volunteering opportunities that the project is seeking help with, over and above voice recordings, I would be very enthusiastic to see what assistance I could provide. I've always had a knack for utilizing new technology, for some reason, so while I've not formally studied website development or coding, perhaps I could provide support to someone who has. 

I am very excited to find out about this project, and I look forward to hearing back from you!;Voice Donor Financial Other;1;0;0;1;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

6614;Willie Butt;williebutt@aol.com;505-331-1150;I recently heard about your program on a public radio program and was intrigued! 

My late mother-in-law, Dolores Butt, was a professor of Speech and Communicative Disorders at the University of New Mexico here in Albuquerque. Through conversations with her, and working in her office transcribing tapes of children with cerebral palsy, it was painfully obvious that some sort of communication with these children could change their world.

If there is a way I might be able to contribute to the cause, I would love the opportunity.

Thank you!

6700;Tim Harrison;tim@bigstupidfun.com;310-903-1173;The TED talk nearly brought me to tears. Almost everything that I love about my life is due to my voice. I've been a singer (semi-pro and professional at times) as well as a voice actor. It's brought me so much joy that I can barely imagine what it would be like to not have that. To be able to help contribute to someone having their own voice absolutely humbles me, and I am so excited to do this. I have a small home studio that I can record from. And I've passed the TED talk on to my network of singers and voice actors.

6756;KELLY LANGFORD JOHNSON;klangfordj@yahoo.com;850-748-2656;Firstly, I want you to know that I heard about the project on NPR this afternoon, March 11, 2014.
I am a female, turning 41 June 15, 2014. Many say that I look and sound very young for my age. Yet, I can do a few voice types depending on the situation. I feel interested in being a donor voice for life, so when the technology becomes available to the masses of people who want a voice for later stages in their life, I would love to donate my voice as I age, too. I grew up in a middle-class family, and have completed my BS degree in Education from Penn State University, class of 1995. I live in Pensacola, Florida on the Gulf Coast Panhandle. I love kids, but don't have any of myown. As a curious person I consider myself to be a life-long learner; and as an educator, I consider myself an advocate especially for children and more generally for people, animals and our environment. I like to volunteer, and if I can help with your project in any way, please feel free to consider using my skills in other ways, but especially my voice. Thank you for the opportunity to add to your wonderful project!
Sincerely,

6846;Krystal Blackmon-Rhodes;kblackmon-rhodes@escambia.k12.fl.us;850-587-3159;I teach students with disabilities. I understand how difficult it can b get students to use their communication devices. I am certain that although your method may be lengthy and requires technical wizardry - the life changing impact it has on the recipients is worth all the time and money. I am a member of the Council for Exceptional Children, it's a professional organization for teachers of students with disabilities, and their families as well as individuals with disabilities. I know that showcasing this service through CEC would enable your project to grow exponentially. I live in Florida and the State Division of CEC has a call for proposals with a deadline in May for the conference in Oct. I'd love to do what I can to facilitate a presentation at the State level. The number listed above is my home number - 850 469-5551 is my office number. Currently, I teach in the Hospital/homebound setting and am not bound by the four walls of the classroom. I know of a student whose quality of life and access to education would be greatly enhanced if he were able to get a vocalid voice. 
Our area (Panhandle of Florida aka Lower Alabama) is home to a relatively famous bar the FloraBama. The owners of this establishment started a songwriter's festival years ago. As a result, there are several small recording studios in the area. I bet once the owners were to learn of your work - they'd donate the use of their studios. Our area also houses Escambia Westgate School - (it's a bit famous too - Check out the Lacey Collier MultiSensory Snozelen Complex on the web) Prior to moving to the Hospital/Homebound setting - I worked with the SLP's there closely as I was the middle school reading teacher. I feel certain - that once they hear about your remarkable work - they'll be on board as well!!

It depends on what you have in mind, and where people need to be located in order to be a voice donor. I would love to help out.;Voice Donor Financial ;1;0;0;1;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

6907;Nancy Simko;lwhsimko@gmail.com;7067412123;I'm a 61 yr old female; 5'6"/110lbs. My voice is in the Alto range, and smoking has added a husky quality. I'm often mistaken for a man when I'm on the phone. I made my living for a number of years as a tour guide, and was often told my voice/diction/accent was easy on the ears. My background is Southern, so I have a bit of a drawl.
If a few hours spent doing what I love best (talking) can give a voice to a stroke or throat cancer survivor or anyone else with whom my voice is a good fit then I'm your woman!;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

6909;Travis Wagar;Traviswagarcontracting@gmail.com;5414015021;I'm a 34 year old male. I'm have a fairly mellow personality that comes out in my speech. I'm in a Baritone range. I'd love to donate my voice. 

Is also like to see if my 7year old would like to contribute. She wouldn't be able to read the phrases but she could repeat the phrases as I feed them to her. I'm not sure if that's an option with how you're currently set up. She has a cute little voice with a lot of curious passion in her. 
Please send info on how you do recordings, and/or what is an appropriate type of file to format the recordings, if done at a home recording studio or home computer. I have access to decent recording equipment via friends who work with sound. But if a decent mic recording thru an iMac app (like garage band) would be a high enough quality, I think I would have a number of friends who are interested in contributing.

How exciting! and I very much want to add my voice. ...a little bit about me? hmm, ....uh, I'm in my 50's - and yes, I've often been told my voice is a) melodic b) sexy c) it carries and on a couple of occasions am I a guy. ....I like it best when I get told A.... lol.. I've many and varied interests. My basic life philosophies are live by the golden rule and yes, we are our brother's keeper and don't pass up an opportunity to "walk in another's shoes". I've some college education but am basically a blue collar worker who has done everything from wait tables, to assistant-teaching ESL classes, to retail worker, taxi driver and currently I'm a part-time poker dealer and I do volunteer work for AARP and a local non-profit, New Vista Community.

I found the link to Dr. Patel's TED talk via a community of voice coaches on Facebook. If you reach out to VASTA (Voice and Speech Trainer's Association), and Paul Meir (International Dialects of English Archive founder), I'm sure you'll cultivate some fruitful collaborations.

7113;Sam Moore;sam@samiam.com;336-675-4956;I heard of this on NPR and was absolutely moved by it. If contributing my voice would help someone, how could I not do so?

7114;Bryan Harston;bryan@harston.net;2147271199;My skill sets include professional Voice-Over (VO) narration, as well as audio mixing and engineering. I work from a small one-person office/studio in which I record and edit studio-quality spoken-word sequences. 

I heard of your program and immediately felt compelled to offer my services for something so profound and life-changing as providing those without speech the means to communicate in their own unique voice ... something most of us take for granted every day. 

I would be pleased to assist in whatever capacity would be most useful. 

My first thought, of course, was to donate my own voice. I'm a 52-year-old male, baritone-voiced. Raised in Colorado, I speak essentially un-accented middle-American English. But can easily add (moderate) regional inflections from such areas as: New England; Eastern seaboard; Deep South (GA, AL, the Carolinas); Southwestern US (Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas), and Midwest (MN, Chicago), etc. (Please note I'm not suggesting making a "caricature" version of any voice; I'm merely noting that, where appropriate, I can gently inflect my voice to sound more regionally accurate.) I also read and speak clear and appropriately-accented German, Italian, and Spanish. 

Incidentally, my 15-year-old son and 12-year old daughter are also keen on the idea of voice donation. (The NPR story I heard focused on kids' voices as well.)

In addition to voice donation, I can offer my services in audio post-production: Editing, track cleanup (background noise removal, compression, EQ), separating syllables and vocalizations as directed by your engineers, etc.

Please let me know how I might help.

7230;Taryn Leffler;pointofmatters@gmail.com;360-571-0202;Hello Dr. Patel,

I saw your Ted Talks video regarding Vocal ID and am very excited by your work. This ties in to the work I am doing that will enable people who can't move any part of their body or communicate, to speak through an app called "Harold's Voice". It will use the new brain sensing technology, the Emotiv (www.emotiv.com) to pick up specific brain patterns that will be translated into a sound. That sound will then be spoken through the app with an electronic voice. I had been trying to figure out how to eventually record and provide unique voices for the app when your talk provided the answer! 

I am developing the brain language right now that will sync with the Emotiv and have also started a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for my "Making Harold's Voice" project. Please see my link: 

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1464940782/making-harolds-voice

I was thinking of adding to my Kickstarter campaign a gift that the donor could provide their voice to a recipient through your website. Is this something that you would be open to? My campaign started a few days ago and will end on April 12, 2014. I look forward to any ideas that you have on this and to help further your project.

Thank you,

Taryn Leffler

My name is Erica Mitchell, and I am a public health researcher and anthropology graduate student at the University of Alaska Anchorage. I heard Rupal Patel's TEDTalk and wanted to see if I may be able to donate my voice to your project. I've been told I have a deeper voice for a younger woman (I'm 25), and often receive jokes about "NPR" quality. I don't know if that is actually true, but I'm complimented on it every so often, and would very much like to share it. 
Please feel free to give me a call or send me an email, I hope I can help out.

7467;Jennifer Poupard;jenniferapoupard@gmail.com;312-636-4748;I just listened to the NPR version of the TED talk and banking my voice sounds like something I can do to help someone! I grew up around people of differing abilities. My mom is a VI specilaust, I had a step sister with a severe cognitive disability. I volunteered in an elementary special education class for two years where I met children who used communication devices. They always seemed disconnected from the voice, especially when I knew what their voices sounded like. Hearing the personalized voices on the TED talk was amazing and I'd love to be a part of this. I've also been a performance poet and understand the way a voice really shapes the way we communicate.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

As someone who loves radio and podcasts, I really appreciate the unique traits of different people's voices.

7559;Erika Stocker;tokyopottery@gmail.com;704-733-8631;From the story I heard on NPR, I remember hearing that you wanted to match the age, etc. to the person receiving the voice. Here's a little bit about me:
I'm a white female aged 42. I grew up in North Carolina, but with midwestern parents. To Northerners, I sound Southern, but to many Southerners, I "don't sound like I'm from around here." I completed college. I speak a little Mandarin, French, and Japanese so foreign words used in English don't throw me off too much.

An idea about where to make the recordings:
In your FAQ, you mentioned developing a website to go to record at the donor's leisure. Have you thought about a general account on Skype? I believe a video/sound recorded message can be sent to someone who isn't online at the time. How about using that? 

An idea about local places for voice donors to make their recordings:
If donors live near a college that has a Communications Department, they might be a sound booth there. A local radio station might donate time for the recordings and use it as a write-off. Many years ago, I visited a place where they make recordings for the blind. They had a sound booth.
I'm sure you might have thought of the above suggestions, but just in case....!

Good luck with your organization. It's a fabulous thing you all are trying to accomplish!;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I am a voice over talent residing in the Toronto area. I have my own small in-home recording studio, and would be able to produce the content that you require in whatever standard format necessary. I would be most proud to offer my voice to this incredible endeavour. You can review a sample of my voice here: http://www.voices.com/people/JeremyLogan 

Aside from the Voice Donor box, I also checked the Other box, as I have a year of past experience as a volunteer grant writer (something that I discovered I love doing) for the non-profit organization Literacy Bridge, to help further their Talking Book initiative. While admittedly no expert, when it comes to grant writing, I have a passion for the process and the 'thrill of the hunt' in securing meaningful money. Should this be an area that you do require any assistance, it is certainly something that I would like to discuss with you.

I wish you every success in your efforts.

With my thanks,

I think this is almost the opposite of what you are doing, using the end product you are trying to create, but if you wanted to test out some of your voices, text to sound or something I would be interested in seeing how we could collaborate.
Also I seem to get very good recordings using a headset the Logitech wireless 800 and Audacity by sourceforge - we store our recordings in DropBox.... if you could have a huge DropBox account - perhaps they would be willing to donate an account to you and then users could sign up for their own,,,, what if LogiTech would donate headsets to everyone who agreed to be a donor? Audacity is open source and free,
Idealist is piloting a new project of Connectors - get into the Connectors group and get them to send ideas to groups - really I would be happy to put together a how-to video of how to record your voice using Audacity and headset and save it in a DropBox account shared with VocalId if you would like that. I think this is a marvelous project - all the best to you.

But people have made reference to my "gentle voice" or "sweet voice." Certainly the reading aloud has been useful -- my husband's illness makes it difficult for him to read, so i read to him before bed or while we're waiting in a doctor's ofifce, etc. Although I expect you'll have your own screening process.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I thought that maybe my voice would able help someone with a similar background so I'm giving my information in case you need me as a donor. I would be happy to help. Thank you for the amazing work!;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I'm willing to donate, including my time, voice, skills (programming, web development/design, graphic design/animation, education, documentation- explaining/simplifying technical ideas, familiarity with open source culture, and I work with/serve people with various disabilities for fun.) to this cause.

But first I'm curious of how 'non-profit' and open this is. I did not find much information on this topic yet. Sorry if I overlooked it.

- Is the technology patented/proprietary OR public domain/open sourced/open standard?
- How much does this cost the recipient?

I'm looking forward to your response.

7933;Sheldon Alderton;alderton.sheldon@gmail.com;306-715-2333;Hey VocalID!

My name is Sheldon Alderton. I am 22 years of age and I reside in Saskatoon Saskatchewan Canada! It's a mouthful I know.

I live in the Paris of the prairies with my beautiful fiancÃ©, Vanessa, and our one year old daughter Jaelle. 

We are a very busy bunch. Vanessa is a make-up artist for MAC cosmetics and I work construction as well as taking classes online to hopefully "better" our future.

Anyways, enough about me! 

I head about the Vocal ID program through the TED radio hour ( I am totally obsessed and listen all the time). I was almost brought to tears when I head the reaction of the one boy who said "I have never heard me before". It makes total sense, we wouldn't fit a 13 year old female amputee with the leg of an NFL linebacker so why give her that voice. 

Growing up I have never shut up, literally. In grade 2 my teacher told my parents that she was encouraging my need to speak because "Someday it will make him a lot of money". Well so far I am broke and my lack of silence has gotten me into nothing but trouble! Well the occasional good thing has came from it but I'm still looking for that one big thing! 

Now though, I have found it. I would absolutely LOVE to donate my voice to help others who do not have the ability to be heard. It is the smallest thing I can do, and easiest seeing as I love to talk! This is the perfect opportunity to use my voice for the betterment of society. 

Also I would be willing to be an advocate for the cause and I would love to help out in anyway possible, even if it is just spreading the word!

I can be contacted anytime by of course email and my phone is never at rest. Feel free to call if you have any further questions.

I think this is a great idea and I would love to help out in anyway I can.

I look forward to speaking with you!

7966;rebecca hom;backroadsteller@gmail.com;3608780838;I am a performing traditional storyteller. The women in my family have a history of stroke for at least 3 generations that I know of. For those reasons, I have contemplated the loss of speech as probably the most devastating impairment I could incur. The ability to communicate our thoughts, emotions, and desires is a great gift. I have been in situations (in foreign countries) where making myself understood was a great, and sometimes frustrating, effort. I would like to contribute my voice in helping someone communicate in speech for themselves. I have an in-home sound studio of sorts, and I record mp3s on an Audacity program. I have the time and desire to be part of your project. Thank you so much for this! Rebecca

7973;Terry Close;taclose@msn.com;;In my excitement for having found you (Rupal Patel's TED talk), I am thinking aloud: I work in the middle school (6-8) in a school district in a small city. We, from K-12, are dedicated to community service projects. I believe we even have a small recording studio, if not at the school, we do have a local TV channel, and private studios that have welcomed internships in the past. Our 7-12 graders also have school-issued Dell laptops, supported by a very active technology department. Our district autism team works with a number of students whom, I'm sure, would love to hear their own voice. How incredibly motivating that must be! I think I could find many interested students and adults......

That said, I would be very interested in contributing to your project in any way that would fit into your plan.

What about a website that makes you record a small sample and then let's you play around with your voice and mix it with Morgan Freeman's just for fun? Even if these samples don't have the necessary size and quality to be used as "filter prosthetics", they might draw attention to the cause and serve as data for further research. Say I had my full 3 hours of samples recorded, could I then also use it myself to synthesise speech, say in a foreign language?

8009;Maureen Taft-Morales;mightymotm@aol.com;301-802-9497;My voice: I have been told by many people that I have a very pleasing voice to listen to. I enunciate clearly, and did radio work when I was younger, so I have experience recording my voice. I love to read aloud - in high school I read children's literature on the competitive forensics team, and my children loved my repertoire of voices for their bedtime reading.

My age, size, sex: I am a petite woman in my 50's; 5'2" tall.

Why I would like to be a voice donor: I was moved by the story about Professor Rupal Patel's work on NPR, and similarly chagrined that a young girl would have to use the voice of a man to communicate. Donating my voice would be an easy and pleasurable way to improve someone else's life. It would also be a way to honor my late mother, who lost her voice and ability to communicate to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Perhaps my voice could help another woman with ALS regain her voice.

My family is rather lucky. Though many of us have autism, ours is mostly the high functioning very verbal variety. Many of the kids I've met recently from my son's class cannot speak and they and their parents are in constant anguish. I feel strongly that everyone should have a voice and even more strongly that it should sound like themself.

I know that you are still in the setup process. I think that I could sell it much more easily if donors could somehow hear or even use the voice generator that they develop. It would be amazing if I could promise my friends that at the end of their 3-hour session, they could type any text into their computer and hear themselves say it. Or, that failing, if they could at least hear a sample of their voice saying "I love chocolate", or reciting the Gettysburg Address or something, that could be really promising.

8117;Rick Sands;Rick@rvsaadvertisng.com;607-797-4222 x10;Bumped into Professor Patel's TED Talk one night on my local PBS station on the way to JC Penney. Was compelled to sit in the car and hear her finish. Perhaps my favorite section was the young girl's new voice responding to the interviewer with
"That's big, fat Yes!" Here was a personality! What a gift!

Next day, at lunch with my granddaughters, I watched a young mother ask her wheel chair bound and vocally disabled son a question. He answered in a guttural tone only his Mom could understand - and I thought of this project.

This seems to be a remarkable idea. We are a small ad agency located in Binghamton, NY with our own recording studio. We have access to a variety of voices and are interested if we might assist in some modest fashion to help build your voice archive. And. we'd like to spread the word.

Let's start with what's required to record and the type of audio files you prefer.

May we assist?

8176;Stephen Roberts;sforoberts@gmail.com;18680052414;Good day,

An American living in China, I am the managing editor at an English expat magazine. I have experience doing voice work professionally, and am hosting an Web series for life in Dongguan, Guangdong. We call it HERE!DG Plus because it expands upon the month's print magazine and interlocks our Web site as well. 

My personal motivation, after hearing of your organization on NPR last night, is due to my inspirational sister. Sara Kate Roberts was the March of Dimes poster child for some years in the late 80's and is now working for Tom Cousin's Foundation helping to revitalize American urban areas. She has cerebral palsy. I have suffered along with her as she struggles with speech, keeping her interpersonal relationships underdeveloped. 

I stop now, because I fear this is too long already, but I hope to be able to assist in your project. 

Good day, 

Stephen Roberts

8342;FrankieJo Ellis;joey_green420@yahoo.com;(801) 809-1828;I am so excited to hear of this project. I have worked with individuals w/ disabilities for most of my adult life. Seizure Disorders, severe Autism, Cerebral Palsy or other neurological disorders were the path of life, on which these individuals were forced to walk. A large (the majority) number of these individuals never had the ability to speak; never had the ability to express themselves or communicate with others. I, firsthand, witnessed the frustration, the anger, and the agony, that was naturally felt. I always thought that being unable to express yourself and communicate with others, was the cruelest disability to live with. I was listening to a "TedTalks" podcast and heard of this amazing project. I'm an organ donor, but I've had many health issues, throughout life, so when I do die, my organs may not be what's needed. Being a voice donor would not only allow me to give of myself to make someone's life a higher quality but also see the results in this lifetime.

I've been fascinated by TTS and speech recognition for years now. My father has advanced Macular Degenration so not only can I relate to the pain of loss or degradation of a sensory ability but I also know it could happen to anyone.

I can't change the world but if I can make it a better place for a person or more, that's good enough for me. The fact that you have dedicated yourself to helping overcome the the vocal identity constraint of thousands, is heartwarming.

While I can certainly commit to being a voice donor, I can't commit to helping the organization raise funds or create a business plan. However, I may be able to come up with some ideas or pitch this to my circle of professional contacts to help the effort on.

I do have one question and concern. In light of emerging technologies that rely on technologies like retina scans, fingerprint readers and voice signatures - keeping individual donor details such as names and addresses is an important responsibility to protect against identity theft and fraud. I hope that VocaliD recognizes this.

Finally, I earn a living as a software sales person. I have great respect for our ability to communicate via speech as we humans do. While most people take speech for granted as they go about their day, we can help remind them that not everyone is as lucky. And should they ever lose their ability to talk - would they all like to sound like Stephen Hawking to their wives, mothers or children?;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

8538;Terri Swallow;terri.ann.s@gmail.com;;Hi,

I was listening to the segment with Rupal Patel on the Ted radio hour podcast and was truly inspired on my drive into work today. It was so touching to hear about the reactions recipients had when they heard their new voices I was nearly to tears while battling traffic into Boston. I'm a web developer with experience with Apache webserver systems, primarily using PHP, MySQL, JS (Backbone, jQuery etc) and I've also tinkered with iOS application development (emphasis on TINKER there) and I'd love to know what progress your teams have made for a webapp or smartphone application to record for voice donors and if there is an open source initiative to support such development that I can contribute to?

Also I'm very interested in contributing as a voice donor outside of my technical knowledge. I'm always inspired by people who are giving others a voice.

So I pretty much learned English from her growing up and many people I meet don't even realize I'm from Texas at first. I know how to articulate and speak slowly and clearly. Also, I have my own small home music studio at home with professional recording software, professional mic, and mic filter to catch all the pops that occur during voice recording. So I can easily record the speech transcript in the quiet privacy of my own home.

8644;Michael Brown;musical.brown@gmail.com;905.549.5576;Hi Rupal & Tim,
 How are you? Great I hope. First off I'd like to congratulate you both on all of your research and the positive outcome that you've been giving to individuals with speech impediments. I think its such a great technology that has helped to give someone back their own voice.
 My name is Michael Brown and I live in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I came across your video and found out about you through TED talks. I'm a recording studio owner and audio engineer who also owns a vocal talent agency with a growing pool of voices. I'd love to be able to discuss with you ways that I might be able to help or learn about the next direction you're taking to make this bigger than it already is.
 I think what you guys are doing is priceless in the eyes/ears of these individuals who have been trying to find their own voice. As a singer/vocalist myself, I wouldn't know what to do or how to express myself without my own voice. You're really on to something here and I'd love to help be apart of it. Please feel free to contact me anytime.

Thanks for your time,

8648;Philip Kao;pkao@sga-inc.net;;I'd like to donate my voice to a voice bank. Also, a couple suggestions:

I heard of you through the TED radio hour, and I think you all are onto something really great. However, I'm noticing that your branding could definitely use work. Everything still very much looks and feels like an academic project. Simple things can be changed to call more people to action. For instance, a url of "voicegive.com" would be much more clear and easy to remember for the regular person (especially hearing it on the radio), instead of than "vocalid.org". That is because in their experience, they are giving a voice - they are not ID'ing vocals. Try not to lead with what you're doing, but lead with providing the experience you want people who interact with you to have. Tough to do when you have the curse of knowledge and are so close to the work, but it is crucial if you want to get people to do something.

I am a social marketer and my company consults for mostly local governments - we basically try to improve the environment and our communities through behavior change campaigns, and making impact through the sum of those individual actions.

Anyway, keep up the great work!;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

That being said, I can only image the impact that can have on a person's psyche or their sense of wholeness. The thought of the printed word, conveyed without the nuance and richness of human emotion makes me hurt - like everything needing to be followed up with an emoticon simply to imbue thought with feeling. I would be happy to donate my time and voice in order to give to one who lacks for themselves.

I meet lot of people in my work with a speech impairement and they use some replaiced or assisted communication method (like speec synthesizer or communication boards as well as signed supported speech). I saw your speech in TED and I was very impressed. At the moment I'm attending at CSUN2014 in San Diego and I've met lot of people who use someone elses voces. I would like to donate my voice to someone who needs it in Finland or somewhere else. I can also develop this work in Finland with you if needed.

Maybe you could find a way to get voice studios around the country to donate studio time and resources to your project - especially when their equipment is otherwise not being leveraged for profit. A non profit structure that they could contribute gifts in kind to might support that. I'm interested in helping with my voice or with contributing to your business plan strategy.

8922;Sara Walke;sewalke@gmail.com;719-632-1687;I understand the importance of voice and the messages voice can transmit, regardless of the words uttered.

In college I was a student of theatre. Effectiveness as an actor is dependent on the use of voice.

For the last 15 years, I have been a teacher of English as a Second (or third, or fourth...) Language.

This project is exciting! I heard about it on TEDx. 

I hope to have the opportunity to participate.

I speak with a british, southern counties (Cambridge) accent that's about as typical as they come, and I've got experience recording it for voiceover script reads as well as a decent quality mic at home that might come in handy and save on studio time! Happy to send on a couple of clips if it helps at all.

I don't think I've come across anything as unique as this before and for once I think I could actually be of help to someone, so I'd gladly lend my voice if ever anyone needs it.

Best of luck with the project and to all that it helps in the future.

9147;Dale Johnston;goobering@gmail.com;+447595245700;Hi

I'm a software developer from Glasgow, Scotland. I'm currently doing a fair amount of work on a streaming media platform for the marine industry, and hold a 1st class BSc (Hons) in Audio Technology. I'm currently proficient in C# .NET / SQL Server, and have developed several applications leveraging advanced features in VLC (audio/video streaming, transcoding, etc.) and Wowza Media Server. I've done a few independent audio production jobs, and previously held a ProTools instructor qualification. 

Your project is *interesting*! I may be able to devote some time on either recording my own voice (presuming you're looking for reasonably intelligible Glaswegian), or software development. I'd greatly appreciate a little more information on the specifics of voice donation. 

Have you considered making use of the public domain voice samples available from LibriVox.com? There are currently several thousand full length audiobook readings performed by solo reader:

9170;Matthew Harrison;m_w_h@icloud.com;;This is perhaps a bit more advanced than the stage at which you are currently, but I also speak French reasonably fluently, and that got me thinking, perhaps in the future, once you've mastered the process for English, you could receive donations for English speakers speaking in foreign languages, for people who spoke more than one language and lost their voice. The sounds between languages vary wildly and it might be nice for someone who gets a "voice donation" to be able to use "their" voice to speak another language, if the two languages came from the same donor. Particularly since using synthetic voices designed for one language to speak another language has horrible results... Just an idea!

9241;Karen Hughes;Disastra@btinternet.com;01267267438;Hi, I work at the DVLA call centre in Swansea, therefore I talk for a living. I always enjoyed reading to my cildren when they were young also, so would be more than happy to contribute my voice if possible. Currently don't have a 'posh' 'phone so would need to find another way.
I am 50 this December, and Welsh. I can only speak English 'though.
 am also an experienced administrator if there was anything i could help with in that direction.

I hope that some of my skills and abilities may help your project and its goals. I have over 20 years experience as a professional announcer and producer, and have my own professional-grade recording facility for voice-over and music production. I have not worked in a frequent capacity as a VO artist in some years, but still read regularly for industrial and promotional applications.

I am a PHP programmer as well as an HTML and CSS coder.

My other discipline is my work as a professional photographer.

I would be glad to assist in whatever way I can. Recording studio-grade speech in normal inflection would be an easy way for me to assist.

My best wishes to your goals,

What a wonderful concept you have here! I am a 39 year old male employed as a software developer. I was raised in the south by college professors who had a huge attention to my diction and speech. Apparently after "more cheese please!!" my first words were actually complete sentences. I now live in New England and have blended some phrases into my speech but I still do not drop my R's. I sang through high school and college, performed in plays, and ran my college radio station.My wife says that I speak very well and that I should do it more often. Her graduate degree is in Speech Pathology. I will also be sharing your information with her .

let me know how I can help and have a great day,

9364;Meredith Schwartz;mschwartz@earthling.net;;I'm happy to volunteer, but in addition, if you haven't already, you might want to look into partnering with Learning Ally. They already have volunteer readers producing audiobooks for the blind and print-disabled. Since they are already producing several hours' worth of sentences each, you might be able to offer them an opt-in -- or even better, an opt-out -- to have their voices donated based on those recordings. (If LA's existing equipment doesn't record at the level of detail you need, it still might be more cost effective to equip them going forward than to set up a collection facility from scratch).

Also, if standard equipment will do, you might want to reach out to StoryCorps and/or public libraries, which increasingly include recording studio equipment, as potential collection points for voice donation around the U.S., if not the world.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I'm a professional sound designer/audio engineer. I'm really interested in your project. (I've actually been considering going back to school to study electrical or computer engineering so I could have the option to work on hearing/speech related systems like this in the future.)

I'd be interested learning more about your product from a technical aspect but I at the very least I'd be willing to donate voice recordings. I may also be able to edit voice clips on a limited scale unless you have some kind of automated system (which I'd love to learn more about).

Cheers!

I have a studio-quality microphone and recording software at home which I use to make music, so I can obtain good quality audio of my voice.

I saw Rupal Patel's TED presentation which inspired me to become a part of this project. Let me know if I can be of assistance!

Look forward to hearing from you,

Regards

I work for a private practice of Speech Pathologists in Northern California called Peninsula Associates. One of our managers forwarded me your broadcast.

This subject is near and dear to us, as many of our therapists work primarily with clients using AAC devices.

Although I am unable to offer financial support at this time, I would be happy to participate as a voice donor when you're in need of one. I recently had my thyroid removed, and the doctors kept warning me that I could lose my voice from the surgery. Fortunately, all went well, and I still have my voice, and I feel like participating as a donor is another way to show my gratitude for having a voice, as well as help those who do not. If you're curious what I sound like, the best way I can describe my voice is that I'm soft-spoken, a bit of a sing-song type, and I enunciate very well. I'm a 32 year old female, half Chinese and half Caucasian, and born and raised in California. If there is anything further you'd like to know, please feel free to contact me.

I am an American voice artist based in London and specialize in (and teach) character voice. I have a question and an idea. 

If the donor has the ability to significantly alter their vocal characteristics (pitch, tempo, rhythm, tone, placement, accent and mouth movement) could they not make more than one voice donation? 

The idea is this: in addition to matching random donors to those needing synthesized voices, what about also being able to special order the voice to suit the end user? There are more voice artists out there like me who want to help. And we all know many others whom we could recruit to donate their voice. 

My voice has been my most precious gift. I can think of no better way to give back than to share it with someone who needs one.

I am a student of phonetics and speech science at Ludwigs-Maximilians-University in Munich, Germany.

Some of my fellow students have come across Rupal Patel's TED talk about VocaliD (which was a fantastic talk!) and we would like to contribute.

We have a studio at university, where we can pretty surely make recordings so we wanted to ask how exactly this is done. Also, do recordings have to be in English? Most of my fellow students have German as their mother tongue.

I am not sure if our technical expertise is enough for contributing to programming/developing. Please let us know what that would involve and which skills are needed.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

All the best,

I'm a 46 year old man.

I think I have a pretty generic voice, raised in Southern California, 10 years in the Pacific Northwest and now 12 years in Atlanta... so no real 'accent' to speak of. 

I have been a radio 'dj' in the past and do occasionally provide a voice for TV promos where I work.

They have pro-quality recording booths in many cities for people to record and share their personal stories, perhaps you can solicit the use of those booths for people to record their voices as well? I believe they also have a StoryCorp bus equipped to record stories, something you can maybe replicate or use? Just a thought, never hurts to ask, right?

As a separate issue: My Aunt was diagnosed with ALS last year and has been losing the ability to speak. We have some recordings of her former voice, which is now extremely slurred, etc. I'm wondering if it's possible to make use of one or more recordings of sentences we have of her former voice to help create a synthetic voice for her.;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

10178;brandon carr;brandon_carr@yahoo.com;415-342-5765;I am a retired programmer with a son with CP. This sounds very interesting for my son and quite a few kids I know here in the Bay Area. My son went to the Bridge School (http://www.bridgeschool.org/) that specializes in helping kids overcoming disabilities through technology. I wonder if connecting you to Bridge School resources might be able to advance both your programs. I believe they get requests from technical people looking for a way to help out. Just a thought. Not sure how I might help out.

Looking forward to talking.

10239;Morgan LaRocca;calamitymorgan@gmail.com;;You're probably swamped with messages like this, but I heard about you and would be willing to add my voice to a database when you make it. For info about my voice: I'm female, American, 29 years old, 5'9", around 145 pounds, I have kind of a deep voice for a girl. Currently I only have the crappy microphone on my tablet to record with, but would be willing to invest in a headset or microphone, a list of recommendations of affordable models that work well would be really useful, though I guess I could figure something out myself. I do know how to edit (clip, etc) audio files on my computer, if you explained what you wanted recorded and how you wanted it I could probably do that.

Also, this is just a suggestion, but while a game application for kids would be really cool, I think in the meantime a lot of kids would want to contribute out of the goodness of their hearts even if it wasn't a fun game, especially if they got to see the kids like them that it would help. A lot of kids are on YouTube these days, if you made a YouTube video aimed at kids and parents showing them the lives of these kids and how it could help them, it would be a great resource to point kids and parents at and get them excited about the idea, and that's something that's relatively low cost to produce.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I watched your TED talk this morning and think the work you are doing is fantastic. I am an Australian, living in Singapore, and am sure I could find many people in this part of the world that are interested in donating their voices once you get the technology up and running. Please let me know when you're ready to start receiving voices.

Kind Regards,

i am a student and a news anchor at a local radio station in germany. I want to support your project by "giving" you my voice, because just to think that my voice is going to make people happy, help them to have a better life and give them their own vocal identity is one of the most beautiful things i can imagine. Altough i speak english very well, it is not my first language, but german. Is this a problem?
Kind regards,

10497;Phillip Little;phillipwlittle@gmail.com;(214) 883-7833;I'm currently unemployed so I would have more than enough time for the estimated 2-3 hours of recording time. This sounds really amazing, though I'm not sure if voice donors are to go to a specific location or if it's self-recorded which raise questions of possible complications; regardless of whether it is the former or latter.

I just learned of your service. What an amazing idea! I'm a professional musician & producer that works at a studio in the DFW metroplex area of Texas. As such, not only do I have the capability to record my own voice to donate, but also have several friends that do voice over work. I'd love to get more information about donating my own voice to start. Also, please provide me with any additional info on how to support you guys financially, or volunteer wise. Looking forward to helping!

10630;Cody Stubbs;scstubbs@gmail.com;7722020260;White, twenty-four, male, Florida, grew up all over the states, traveled over twenty countries, my accent can change. I am not perfect at any regional dialect, although I could probably practice and get close, but I do have a clear voice. My voice is not low, it is probably average. People understand me well. Sometimes others remark that I speak fast or slow, so I think I can pace my self and add emphasis if needed. Other places I have lived: California, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, West Virgina. When in Europe or Africa people have remarked on how easy it is to understand me. I have not listened to myself speak much, and so of course hearing my own voice is odd. Please feel free and call me to see if my voice might be useful (even though they delete too much data through the phone and quality is lost, it still might help).

I just heard about your project and although I am currently a student and unable to provide much financial assistance, I would be thrilled to find out more about becoming a voice donor. I am located in Toronto Canada, but currently in Singapore until the end of May. I am not sure if I need to be in a particular location to record this speech, but just let me know what it requires and I would be more than happy to give you my time.

All the best, and I just wanted to say this is quite an amazing project.

10747;Dominic Ormsby;shenzilbur@hotmail.com;64 022 199 5482;I am very interested in being a voice donor. I have been told I have a very unique voice that has an accent that is hard to pin point. Being from New Zealand it has a base in the New Zealand accent but often times moves between a Californian and British accent. 

I am a 21 year old caucasian male who has done a little voice over work, screen and stage acting and I have access to a voiceover booth. My voice is very deep with a great deal of resonance. As a hobby I enjoy reading and reciting poetry so I am able to articulate myself to a relatively high degree.

I am excited about the prospect of giving another human being a voice and I look forward to hearing back from your organization.

Kind regards,

While in the US, I started doing stand-up comedy, something I'm still doing to this day, albeit in my home country, The Netherlands. 

About 6 months back, someone who saw me perform advised me to look into voice acting, seeing how I had a â€œvoiceâ€ for it. I've been doing voice overs for 4 months now, and like the work.

I just recently learned about VocaliD and becoming a voice donor, and seeing how I have my own studio, and record daily, I feel like this is something I'd like to help with.

11124;mark hayes;mark@redfrogevents.com;3127257720;Hello, 

I work for a company called Red Frog Events. We are an event planning company based in Chicago IL. In line with our culture one of the big things Red Frog does is give back. One of my jobs here at the office is coordinate our volunteer and outreach program for the company and its employees. I am really intrigued by the study and program you are doing and would like to coordinate and help. 

I am looking to put together a large company give back project and wanted to discuss that further. We have roughly 130 employees in the office of varying age, size, gender, etc. which would fit your target demo, based on the article I ready. I also read in an article that it requires 2-3 hours worth of voice recording per voice? Is that still the case? Is there a way that if we record every one of our employees saying the same passage or phrase, that you would be able to use that to tell which voices you need more from? Basically matching one of our employees with a person in need.

I want to work with you and make something work because your cause is phenomenal, but I don't think I can logistically commit 2-3 hours of EVERY employees time. So if there is a way we can commit 15-20 minutes of everyones time, with a possible longer follow up, that would be great. I am also open to other suggestions as well, this was just the first thing that came to mind.

Thanks so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

11183;Dave Myer;dave.myer@gmail.com;7705198022;I'm a male in my mid 30s with five girls who I'm sure would be more than willing to donate their voices as well. I am fluent in English and can speak German without an accent, have an MBA and work at a fortune 10 company. I have a side business that grew out of need for accent coaching and am passionate about helping people. I only tell you those things, not to brag, but in case it helps you feel comfortable, I'm happy to be a sounding board.

I heard the story on NPR and think this is one of the best ideas out there and would love to help others reflect their own personality in the most accurate way possible.

From an execution model perspective, I think you could take a similar approach to Pandora. They have a panel of experts (usually former musicians) who rate music on about 30 different attributes. They undergo heavy training to be well calibrated among the other raters before they are "live".

In terms of getting the word out, this is an absolutely PR-worthy story and ready to share on shows like Ellen or the Tonight Show. So the revenue model could be similar to a non-profit fund raiser. But I think there is also an insurance-ready revenue stream available that would align more to a private market. The team could partner to get this solution as a treatment option for healthcare.

I know these are bare-bones thoughts, but I'm willing to chat more about them if that's of any interest. If not, I'm happy to give my voice to the cause.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

and feel you are empowering people who lack the ability to express themselves through speech. It's something that 99% of us humans take for granted, and may only get to "walk in their shoes" when we "lose our voice" on occasion when we get sick. That is the point where one really appreciates the power of voice. 

I look forward to contributing my own voice to help with your research and work. I am an Instructional Designer by trade, so if you would ever need help in that regard, please feel free to reach out.

11281;Carl Killian Zahn;carl.k.zahn@gmail.com;309-369-5605;I am vary excited to be a voice donor. 
 A few years ago I temporarily lost the use of my left leg. A stroke was ruled out, as well as a TIA(?). I was back walking a week later after extensive tests, an injection of I don't remember what, and physical therapy. My doctor ultimately said it was what could best be described as an auto-immune reaction to something, but he didn't know what. The point is, because of this incident, I can no longer give blood and I am assuming organ donation is also out. 
 To be able to donate my voice makes me happy that I can still help someone with some part of me.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I just heard your TED talk and was incredibly inspired by the work you are doing. Giving people a voice, literally, what an amazing gift. I work in advertising where I frequently direct voice talents in studios, as well as do demo voicework for my clients. I would love to be a part of this project and lend my voice to it.

I heard about your project and I was so exited with the idea to help others to be able to speak. Trying to imagine live without being able to express myself, don't have a voice, it seams quite frustrating... So I would like to contribute with my voice. However I don't know if I can be of any help, because I'm a native Portuguese speaker, not and English one. I don't know if you already starting with other languages then English, but if you will, please count with me for contribute with my voice. I also speak English, but my accent is REALLY strong, so I can't imagine no one wanting that voice :)
If you need to hear an example of my voice, I have some tutorial videos about MS Office (all in Portuguese), below is the link of one of them: http://www.120segundos.net/videos/v/203

11509;Ambika Pajjuri;ambika.pajjuri@gmail.com;4087022694;I think this is amazing work and such a noble application! It opens up a world of possibilities to the kids and adults using synthesized voices. I have provided my voice for Pearson language testing software, so happy to help.

Also, I have worked with voice synthesis softwares for my work at KidSenz (www.kidsenz.com) and can attest to the difference that real voices and emotions can bring to engagement. Our tests with kids using synthesized voices had kids, teachers and parents complain about the monotone synthesized voice. 

I love the possibilities that the this project will open up for so many people without a voice. In addition, there could be various commercial applications for this project. If done right, the commercial applications can help fund the social project that is currently the primary focus.

I am an entrepreneur with previous experience as a software product manager building wireless networking products. I am happy to help in other areas in addition to recording my voice for the voice bank.

11632;Kimberley Bull;kimberley.bull@hotmail.co.uk;;Hi, 

My name is Kimberley, I'm a 26 year old disabled woman from England that would definitely enjoy donating my voice should you be interested in international donors.

Not only to help others but because I myself may need such technology in the future. I speak very clearly right now but I'm almost completely deaf and as that progresses, I'm worried I might lose the clarity of expression I currently have. 

I also have a severe form of a genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome that may take my voice from me one day due to a number of factors. Between the two issues, I'd love to "bank" my voice in case I eventually lose the ability to speak.

I have many friends that rely on computerised means to communicate and I know that they would all love to have their "own" voice instead of the generic one that is currently available to them. Especially as the only option right now seems to have an American accent. I know this irritates many of my English friends as they want their voice to reflect their own culture and nationality.

I think this is an amazing idea and I'd love to contribute if possible!

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to email me (I haven't provided a phone number as my hearing is too poor to speak on a phone, I can only use email, text or FaceTime on my iPad.)

If you really needed to call me though, I could provide a number for you to contact my PA. She can listen on my behalf, mouth to me what is said, I lipread what she says and can then reply verbally to the person on the other end.

Thank you again for such an amazing project!

Kind regards,

My name is Diane Arellano, I work for a non-profit which hosts a free world class summer concert series which reaches over 50,000 people. I would like to invite VocaliD to become a community partner and promote/ recruit from our audiences. Our community partners participate free of charge and reach diverse age, social, and racial demographics through our Children's Night, Latin music, Jazz and Americana music programming. 

For more information please visit our website at http://www.levittla.org/ To view last year's summer concert headlining acts visit http://www.levittla.org/2013-summer-music-festival-calendar/

Hello! My name is Rebecca and I am a 5'4, 26-year-old female currently living in Washington, DC. I'm working as a web consultant until the fall, when i'll be attending graduate school for urban planning.

I heard about Vocal ID through TED Radio and NPR and thought i'd contribute. Not sure if you need information about my voice. For the most part, I think my voice is a little lower than most female pitches. Maybe it hangs around a C note?

11743;Emil Pierre;pi-erre@live.se;+46707581015;Even-though I am born, raised, and currently living in Sweden, the Cambridge English Exams, my A grade from college english, and myself, think that I could partake in this kind of a project. I received a B+ on the CAE exams last year, and I hope that this is proof enough of my english vocal capabilities. I would be more than happy to. I hope that there is someone out there with the need for a young swedish mans english voice. I hope this project does too. I can add that I have access to all proper equipment to record good-enough sounding data, with mics and recording software in my School.

My name is Rob Peek, and I actually run the Licensing and Publishing department at Fearless Records.
I am actually a trained vocalist, and have professionally recorded music and dialogue for multiple projects.
I LOVE my voice. It has gotten me through plenty of tough times, and allowed me to express myself through many means beyond speech, and I would love nothing more than to donate and record what I can to help someone else find a voice of their own!

I have my own studio to record in, and can given a weekend to record, I could send you guys audio tracks as soon as you need! 

Please feel free to reach out to my email or phone number any time!!

Cheers!

I am a 27 year old male from southern California. I have a slight accent that I've been told sounds vaguely southern, but I also have a "performing" voice that I use when reading aloud or acting, in which I speak more clearly and enunciate more. I would be willing to provide either my "performing" voice or my normal speaking voice, or both. I am married, and it is possible that my wife would be willing to contribute her voice as well. She sang in choir for several years, and has a very pleasant voice.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

11859;Sean Curtis;curdog@gmail.com;4127708553;I currently work for a pharmacy and I end up doing lots of different things, one of which is delivering medications to residential facilities. I have seen many people with speech synthesizers that enable them to talk, and they do all sound quite similar. I can tell that some of the residents, especially younger, can be self conscious about the voice, and often stop talking on my way past to nurses station.

11862;Jordan Miller;jrmiller88@gmail.com;7033460390;I am a 26 year old male living in Northern Virginia. Give or take, I'm about 6'and I have a slender body. Weighing in around 145. I never thought that I would be able to help someone with my voice, but if there is an opportunity, I will gladly step forward to help in anyway I can. The way someone talks can tell others a lot about them at that moment. Happiness is typically a great way to describe my positivity. If my voice can help, it will bring someone else the chance at being more of an individual and they will hear my happy voice and hopefully it will make changes for the better!

"BetrSpot is a location-based Android & iPhone app. that's meant for first come-first served environments. Find and secure physical spots in crowded places or make money by releasing & exchanging any spot you might be sitting or standing in with someone else." 
I'd love to help with my voice. I also have app. development experience, and could even set up VocallD in BetrSpot as a "push charity" which means a person who makes money from giving up/trading their spot instead of keeping it (the money), can push it to whatever charity (VocalD) they want. Ex, I give up the seat I'm sitting in Starbucks for $10 to someone who really wants it. I can opt to keep $5 and push $5 to VocalID.

I heard a TED talk about this program on NPR a while ago, and decided I would like to contribute! I am actually doing a persuasive speech in my Speech & Debate class about this in a few days. I would love if I could do more to help, but I don't have much money to donate and I haven't even been to college yet. My preferred method of contact is email if it isn't too much trouble, I rarely notice when I have a call or text, as I keep it on silent because of school. Although either will work. Well, I think I have put too much information now! Anyways, I think this is a great cause and would like to do what I can to help. I will try to convince my sister, although she has a super short attention span! Well, that's all!;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

12109;Perri Silverstein;perri.silverstein@gmail.com;2482022959;To the Team at Vocalid:

I am interested in becoming a Voice Donor. I heard about this organization through Twitter. I want to share the gift of voice with those who cannot vocalize for themselves. 
I have been considering doing voice work - I suppose my voice is a bit ...
 cartoon-y. This would be great way to volunteer to the VoiceBank and practice my vocal work. Recording 2-3 hours would not be a problem. 

I look forward to hearing from a VocalID representative.

I heard your TED talk and love your idea. If I can help your project do let me know. Even a pdf of the phrases you wish recorded could help in the mean time. 

Everyone deserves the right to express themselves freely. I can't begin to fully imagine the frustration of those whose ability to do so is impaired, especially when such an elegant and personalised method of easing some of that frustration is possible. 

All the best with your project.

My name is Caleb Newman, and I am interested in contributing to the Vocal-ID cause. I am a senior at Bemidji State University (Bemidji, Minnesota), and I am a double major, studying both Business Administration emphasis Finance, and Accountancy. I believe strongly in giving back to my community, and giving back to those around me! I am the president of a service/social fraternity, and have been in that position for two years. We have quite a few philanthropic interests, and we have been featured in our local newspaper for our work. I am also the president of various other organizations on campus, as well as a member of the Charter Commission for our city. I am also an accounting intern for a publicly traded company. If there's anyway I could lend my assistance, I would be more than grateful and willing! I believe I am an intelligent and capable leader, and I am excited to find out if there's any way I can contribute to the project.
Thank you for your time!

12306;Saad Chinoy;saad@pin.sg;68364030;I like the idea and totally get the concept. I love the fact that technology is being put to good use, directly solving a human problem. I will be able to "borrow" some recording studio time if required and perhaps even rally support from friends who may be willing to contribute their time and voices to the cause. 

I must point out though that I'm Asian (specifically Indian) as will be most voices from this part of the world, that's Singapore where we're a mix of English speaking Chinese, Malay, Indian, Indonesian, Philippines, and a range of Europeans.

I'm curious to know the process and exactly what is required of volunteers, the company i work for may be interested in working together with you in a professional capacity as well.

do let me know.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Joe Solo, and I'm a record producer in Los Angeles. My clients include Macy Gray (I developed her from scratch), Fergie, Atlantic Records, Apple, Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, and many others.

I saw your TED talk video a few weeks ago and was very impressed. Yesterday, a colleague of mind suggested I review your web site and contribute my expertise.

And that's why I'm writing - I want to help. 

If you are interested in having a discussion regarding this, please email me at joe@joesolo.com with a handful of times/dates over the next week or two that you wish to talk and I'll let you know what works.

Warm regards,
Joe Solo

12397;Amy Lengeling;Amylengeling@hotmail.com;(612) 437-0615;Hi. I am very interested in this project. I am a speech-language pathologist in an elementary school in Minnesota. I have been piecing together children's voices to create their own presentations with their own voices for the past four years. Through this project, the children who have both speech and language disorders, have been able to describe themselves and their families to classmates. I use prompts to help them record their segments. I have been using only a Photostory program. I have found as in video modeling, children learn more quickly when responding to their own voices. 

I am willing to donate my voice and I will speak to my children, ages 6 and 9 to see if they are willing as well.

12398;Katherine Axtell;katieaxtell1977@gmail.com;913-707-9410;I heard one of your talks on NPR's TED Talks and was moved to tears. Specifically with the comments from the mother's who were hearing their children's voices and personalities for the first time. I am a mother of 3 and could not imagine any greater gift. My voice is small but full of emotion and exaggeration at times. Although I am German by heritage I should have been Italian. My spirit comes through in my voice, and if I could help someone else do the same I'd be delighted. I'd be willing to travel somewhere at my expense to make this happen if you need quality voice recordings.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I work as an AAC specialist (not Speech-Language Therapist) and would love to donate my voice. If I can be of any assistance with assisting to develop the program, I am more than happy to help out.

I can also help with sharing it out and raising awareness of the program. I actually believe the organisation I work for would probably back the program (unfortunately we could not afford to back it financially), but would be happy to encourage all staff and our young volunteers to sign up as donors.

Please email me if there's anything I can do to help out. In the meantime, I look forward to hearing that the program is up and ready for me to start donating my voice!

I had reconstructive chest surgery when I was sixteen to correct a chest wall abnormality. This abnormality impacted my heart and lungs, causing me to become very dizzy while doing the simplest of tasks such as sitting. Now a year and a half post-op I am eighteen and in training for a marathon. If I can do anything to pass on a life changing gift to someone in need then I will try.

I only just heard about this through the TED Radio Hour and I was instantly interested. Of course it would be best and most convenient to do this through a web or iPhone app once that is organized, but I also know people with proper recording equipment and I could seek out their help if needed. Regarding my 'voice background', I am a male and was born (Aug 1983) and raised in Fargo, ND, and moved away from there in 2006. I lived 2 years in the island of Dominica, Eastern Caribbean, and 5 yrs now in Oakland, CA and I currently work in San Francisco, CA. 

I would also be happy to donate a small amount of money to this cause (_$50) although I wish I could contribute more. Have you considered a dedicated crowdfunding campaign through Kickstarter or Indiegogo? I'm sure your recent NPR interview will help out as well. Either way, best of luck and I hope to be of assistance someday in the future!

At the very least, I am more than happy to share whatever time it takes to contribute my voice to helping someone else find theirs. Thank you.;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

12812;Debbie Kutch;d.kutch@hotmail.com;650 224-9849;Hi! 
I am very intrigued by your project! I am a speech language pathologist as well as professional voice actor! I work in an acute care hospital, Stanford University Medical Center in California, and am always looking for ways to assist my patients with AAC devices. And as a voice actor, I enjoy working on projects related to my medical background. I have a home studio and am able to record quality audio that has been used in TV and radio ads, documentaries and eLearning modules. I also have close ties to a voice acting school and can probably round up plenty of budding voice actors who would be willing to donate their time for some valuable experience!

I would enjoy discussing this fantastic project with you to see how my skills and background and connections may be of assistance to you.

Please feel free to contact me by email and/or cell phone.

Regards,

Debbie

12859;Michael brenner;vape@exemail.com.au;;I think this is a great initiative, however I do have my concerns. With future technology as unpredictable as it is, it can be hypothesized that our voices may be used in part to access or control devices or even be a form of personal identification, some time in the future.

I would like to know if the voices will undergo any frequency modulation, pitch and/or delivery changes or anything else that could render the voice non - comparable to the original. If this is possible then as you mention in your faq, could an unaltered copy be stored (or perhaps be given back to the donating party in form of a program that could be safeguarded from unauthorized access etc) and could your company guarantee that the stored voice would not be given to any third party under no circumstances or relinquished control thereof at bequest of any government agency?

12909;Mary Kleiss;mkleiss56@yahoo.com;248-882-6679;Thank you so much for this awesome program! My son was diagnosed with ALS in 2009 at the age of 25 and for the last 3 years of his life he used a commucation device. We use to tease him about his feminin voice and then he got his TOBII which was a male voice. Oh how I longed to hear his voice again! Regis died on Christmas Eve last year. This will make such an inpact for others though! I would love to help as a voice donor and in any other way that I can help promote your program. I can't afford allot of money sadly but I would like to donate maybe 50.00 to the program. I know it's not much but every little bit helps! Regis was big on helping others. We were involved in a program through the University of Bufflo in how using the communication device improved Regis's life. His speech patholigist Lisa Birtach also video taped him using his machine so others could see how important it was to his every day life. Thanks so much for the work you are doing. I know how much it will improve other peoples lives who depend on these devices for every day living. I look forward to hearing from you and I will be activly working on getting the word out to others about your work. Bless all of you.;Voice Donor Financial Other;1;0;0;1;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

12944;Tristan Wheelock;TMWheelock@gmail.com;9412251877;I just listened to Rupal Patel's TED talk and it had me in tears. My mother was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy when I was young and slowly lost motor skills and brain functionality including her voice over the course of about 7 years. For the last years of her life she communicated with a small electronic dictionary. This was in the days before iPhones and iPads. The robotic voice of that tiny machine eventually became her voice in my mind and what she sounded like when I was growing up slowly faded away. It was so sad. I don't want others to have to communicate in this fashion and thus would be honored to donate my voice. I work as a filmmaker so I have access to high end audio equipment and have the skills to make a quality recording. Thank you so much for this excellent work.

If my offer is accepted I am eager to begin a sort of chapter here in Houston were I am positive I can collect a virtual library, albeit a modest library, but with potential to flourish. 
 
I saw Rupal Patel's conference on TED. I share her elation.

This is only my second time submitting my request to assist. I will follow up more thoroughly as I learn more as I just saw the conference a few days ago.

Eagerly awaiting any sort of response,

I heard the Ted talk last night and was very moved...I would really love to donate my voice if you think could be appropriate. 
I live in Hong Kong but I am originally from the South of the UK and am now married to an Australian so my voice is mainly an English 'home county' accent but with a bit of London and a bit of Australian intonation - I am a mother and 40+ 
I currently work as a promo producer so have access to a voice booth and audio engineers who can record my voice and prepare files in whatever format is appropriate.
Let me know if I can provide you will any more information or if you would like me to send you a voice sample.

Let the best - I love your idea of Voice ID - brilliant!

My company is looking for a good charity to work for, I was wondering if you can support this.

We are based in the UK and can easily do recordings in the conference rooms.

Can you let me know further details of how this can be setup?

I'll be having a meeting later today, proposing VOCALiD as an option, but it would be useful to know before hand if this venture is possible.

13122;Mike Broderick;mikebroderick33@aol.com;+4401206383901;Hi. I'm an American voice-over artist (new to the industry) based in the UK. I'm happy to donate my voice to this project.

I have a microphone and recording software, and I can provide you audio files in a variety of formats (including mp3, wav, AFF) via email, cloud, or dropbox etc.
You can hear my voice on my website: www.mikebroderickvoiceover.com.

In addition, I'd be happy to donate a voice-over at no cost for use on your website. If you can provide me a script, I'll be happy to voice it for you. (Or even better if you can find someone to create a web/explainer video for you, I'd be happy to record the voice-over to go along with it for you at no charge.) If you wanted several voices to contribute to a voice-over on your website, I could try and draft in some other voice-over artists.

Your project is making a splash in the voice-over industry. If you'd like to do a guest post on my blog explaining the project and appealing for assistance I'd be happy to post it and send it around within the voice-over community.

Lastly, you need to look up a new technology called ipDTL which enables real-time high quality audio connections via Google Chrome. See ipDTL.com. 

A lot of us are signed up to it and could connect to you in real-time via this technology. You might consider contacting the owner of the company, Kevin Leach, at ask@inqualitymedia.com to see if he might be able to help.

Please let me know how I can assist.

The business while successful for a couple of University students never reached the heights it could because I could not crack the voice simulation challenge. 24 years later I cam across your TED talk and the bulbs went off in my head.

I think using your labs skills, we can create a commercial product that will drive revenue for your project, drive global awareness, and acquire voice donors.

I think your way forward is to commercialize your IP into an adjacent market that furthers your goal of building a voice library and use those proceeds to support the VocalID project and bring voice solutions to the world.

This means that although I've still retained my British accent, it's also been influenced by the dialect from other cultures and nationalities. I used to have a tied tongue, but surgery has repaired that, so now my speech is fine. I'm so thankful for this, and that's why I want to help others find their voice as well. Lastly, I'm a 15 year old female, so my voice basically sounds like a teenage girls, except my voice is slightly lower than others.
Thank you so much for setting up this campaign, it's a wonderful initiative that I'd be honored to be a part of.

I found out about your organization through a post on Reddit and I'm very interested in helping out both by donating my voice and as a programmer. I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology and I've had several past internships as a software developer so I'm sure I could contribute to this project. 

I love language and linguistics. I've taken many classes in linguistics from natural language processing to theoretical linguistics to language acquisition. But I haven't had the chance to do much with language pathology and would absolutely love the opportunity to learn about it while helping to give people a voice to call their own.

Best regards,
Brian Lewis

I was overwhelmed by the profound mix of philanthropic and scientific nature of your work that gives a voice to the voiceless. I am humbled and blessed to see that you use your talents and abilities to help people to identify with themselves. 

I do not know if I can be of any help or if my voice could be used, but if you have any candidates that are similar to my voice pattern or pitch I would be honored to assist you. I cannot offer much given that I know nothing about your area of expertise, but I can offer my voice. 

If I cannot be of any help I want to extend my utmost praise to you for the incredible nature of your work. To use your expertise and goodwill toward humans to help people find a voice is the purest form of social empowerment.

We also develop apps for SLP's and their clients. (http://goo.gl/CE26Tf , http://goo.gl/QtIRn6) We're interested in exploring the development of an app to record voice donations. One thing our coder called out is the apparent one time use for such an app. Are there other functions for such an app, which might give it more utility? Let's set a time to talk.

I work as a UX strategist for an app development company, Bottle Rocket Apps, and we have a yearly hack-a-thon coming up where teams spend 24 hours making something great.

After hearing about your organization via a podcast I was inspired to form a team for this year's hack-a-thon that could make an app to help record voices â€“ or at least get 80% of the way there and inspire coworkers to take it the rest of the way.

I'm at the information gathering phase and have several questions regarding the process of recording voices if someone was available to talk to.

I can be reached via email or phone.

My voice is neither deep or high. I think it has an average tone height, but you would be more qualified to give that judgement. Keeping contact with people in the UK means I talk English several times a week for long periods of time. There is no trace of a Dutch or a typical accent, though native English speakers can hear it's not my first language. This would be most apparent in my 's' and 'sh', which are less sharp than they should be (there is no slur).
I hope I have provided some useful additional information. Regardless of whether or not I can be helpful, this is a truly great initiative, and I hope everything works out.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

13813;Danielle Nahm;Nahmer13@gmail.com;314-703-5210;Hello, my name is Danielle and I am a 16 year old girl who thinks this program is inspiring and absolutely life changing. First off I would like to say the ability to give someone a voice that they can choose is amazing. It is a privilege, not just for the recipient, but for the donor as well. I immediately felt drawn to this program and I feel it would be an honor to participate and change a life in a new and unexpected way. I have been in several choirs and other musical groups for about 8 years. They are a major part of my life and greatly affected and molded me into who I am today. My passion is singing and I don't know where I would be in my life without my voice. I truly appreciate my voice and one day I wish to fulfil my dream and become a voice actress in tv, movies, radio, and broadcasting. Giving my voice to another so they can use it to express themselves would mean everything to me. I see it as giving my most valued talent and gift to people who need it most. I always enjoy serving people and giving myself to others, so this program would give me an opportunity to combine two thing I love most together and change someone's life in an unforgettable way. Words cannot describe the awe I have for what this program is and what it is doing for everyone. Thank you, I admire the work you are doing for others and anticipate to be a part of it in the future!;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I came across your brilliant project while reading the "brainiac" page at the Boston.com website.
I am writing from Brazil and if it would be possible I'd love to donate my voice in Brazilian portuguese so people here can also benefit from your program. 
I am a student of English and Linguistics and I mentioned your initiative in my department and many people showed interest.

I learned an American accent and utilize it as my every-day voice, unless I'm saying something Russian or in a language from one of Russia's sister countries. I'm a fifteen year old girl and am really optimistic. I'm a Visual Arts major and I just want to help. My voice isn't necessarily beautiful in my opinion but if someone wants it, they can have it. Although school keeps me busy, I definitely have time to record little by little at a time until summer comes around. I'm willing to do the testing more than once or however is needed.

I don't know if you have much use for people who's native language is not english. I am German and speak english fairly well, but still with an accent. If this is no problem I'd happily invest the time needed to help give people their own voice. If this would disqualify me from being a voice donor I still wish you all the best.

14003;Gabriela Rivera;Missgabrielarivera@aol.com;6462715460;Hello. My name is Gabriela. I am a Business Major at Monroe College in the Bronx, NY. I just recently was brought to this site and I am overjoyed in the most beautiful way that people have started something like this. I not only want to be apart in contributing a voice for someone, I also think I can help the cause. Like I mentioned I am still a college student and have no expertise on how the human voice actually operates also I am not knowledgeable on programming or developing (yet), and unfortunately I am not financial capable of supporting the cause. However, what I can offer is my time. I am moved by a person's vision and I want to help. I believe as a young adult I would be able to advocate the cause in a relate-able way to my young peers. I feel also my background and where I come from would help influence other kids from the "hood" "ghetto" (basically the poor neighborhoods) to get involved. I understand this may not be something this organization is looking for, and I'm fine with just being a voice donor but I felt it was my duty to inform you of my passion for this cause. Everyone apart of it is beautiful and is what gives people like me hope for a better future and humanity.;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

Heard about this from NPR TED Talk "Extrasensory"
Female, British, 39 - based in/near London, UK. 
Southern English accent non-regional. Pretty good though not perfect enunciation.

I have access to a decent computer, with a headseat and an old version of Audition or Audacity. I have access to my family who I am sure would love to take part if this can be done from home. (10yo male, 65yo female, 18yo female)

I also work in London and on the fringe of the UK radio industry (The Radio Academy). We have no funds to assist but if there are any contacts I can help provide - We know a few people with recording studios or who work at radio stations across the UK - Please let me know.

This is an amazing (and fascinating) initiative. I would love to help if I can.

My name is Kevin and this is a fascinating topic for me. I've been a baritone/tenor singer professionally for a decade and then some and have been told that I have a good speaking voice for radio but I haven't really explored that venue much. I have, in college, recorded my voice for students with disabilities, reading textbooks and such, so I have some experience in reading out loud for long periods of time. I also have home studio equipment I can use. Let me know if I can be of any help. Take care.

14223;Andrew;hum4n@outlook.com;;Hi,
The audio files on the 'How it works' page do not play on Internet Explorer; it is simple to fix though. Internet explorer wont play wav files, even the most recent version, so you need to have them available in both mp3 and wav to play on all browsers. I believe this also is true on older iOS devices, but I might be wrong on that.

I think what you're doing is pretty fantastic, and given the nature of it, its seems quite critical that the audio on this website works so people can understand, so figure it probably worth letting you know, rather than ignoring it.

The idea is great, and perhaps most significantly it clearly has an immediate benefit to people.

If you have the time I'm quite curious to know how it integrates once you have the voices, like is it custom software/devices? or is it all well standardized and easy to integrate with the existing solutions. That's always a sticking point with so many things, but one would like to think its not a problem with such assistive technologies.

She was moved by the story she heard on CBC's Spark program a couple of weeks ago. We discussed it and she is interested in being a donor. She realizes that there are people her age who could use her voice, and that there might not be too many donors from her demographic.

I have a voice booth set up in my house. I can feed her lines and we'd take it in small chunks.

Please let us know when you're ready to move the project forward. We're all excited to be able to participate.

This looks like a very exciting project! I am a 51 year-old male, with mature, baritone voice, and a native (American) English speaker with no predominant accent, but New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Southern influences. I have worked with voice for most of my life, in roles ranging from military and law enforcement, to teacher, trainer, facilitator, and choir singer. I can also work in High German.
I am currently taking some coaching in preparation for voice acting. Because I need some practical experience/exposure, and am also very involved in non-profits/community service, I would love to learn more about how I might help you as a voice donor.

I also produce a resource podcast for parents of special needs children and you can listen to my voice samples there as well: www.specialparentsconfidential.com.

If you have the time, I would love to interview you about this project. Many special needs children are often not able to communicate and I think your work would be of interest to my listeners.

Thanks!

I watched your presentation by Rupal Patel on the YouTube channel TED.

Would love to be your voice donor. That\'s one thing said.

I have another idea which you may be interested in, to add for recipients.

How about adding background music (based on mood) by mixing it with speech synthesis? How about adding pre-sung voices or even ambient sounds from nature?

This might actually enable a whole new world of expression for the recipients who cannot talk and/or hear.

14458;Shirley Ens;sjens@sasktel.net;306-773-2281;I heard about your program on CBC radio and think it is fantastic. what a wonderful gift for someone who needs a voice. I would absolutely love to be a voice donor. I have a very good command of the English language, I speak clearly and my pronounciation is excellent. I am female and almost 60 yrs old. I sing in a community choir which recently performed in Carnegie Hall. We sing in English, Latin and occasionally in other languages. I studied French and German in high school, but do not speak it fluently. My parents were born and raised in the Netherlands, but we spoke English exclusively at home. My mom was the \'language police\' in our home and we were always corrected if we spoke incorrectly....grammar or pronounciation. A bit of a joke, but I am forever grateful that she was so particular in our language. People tell me that I am easy to understand. I often read scripture in my church and am complimented for my reading. Please contact me for any additional information I can provide. Additionally I would love to spread the word about your program, to recruit voice donors or support in other ways. Please consider my application to be a voice donor.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

With that I also have access to a high quality microphone so I could upload vocal samples relatively quick to help your team start morphing the sounds as you need to. Either way, this sounds great! Let me know if I can help.

I am an adult woman, 56 years old, but I am told that I sound like my 22 year old daughter (so I guess I have a young sounding voice in an older body). I was raised in Southern California (moved away after high school), but have lived in Missouri for almost 40 years (so I have a blended accent). I have been told that my voice is unique and easily identifiable, however, I have never been sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing :) Hope I can help you if you need a voice.

Fujitsu gives speech synthesis a realism boost

Fujitsu\'s newly-developed speech synthesis system can produce voices to suit different situations
Image Gallery (3 images)
Speech synthesis has come a long way from the days when computers sounded like a Dalek with a cleft palate, but thereâ€™s still a lot of room for improvement. Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. in Kawasaki, Japan are working to move computers away from sounding monotone or perpetually distracted by developing a new speech synthesis system that can quickly produce high quality voices that can be tailored to suit individual environments and circumstances.

Speech synthesis is one of those technologies that we tend to think of as futuristic, but a moment\'s reflection reveals it to be much more common than you think. It isn\'t just something for having a chat with your smartphoneâ€™s digital assistant app. Itâ€™s a widespread technology thatâ€™s used to help the vision impaired read text, provides emergency information that a simple alarm bell cannot, reads out traffic reports and travel information at airports and railway stations, features in museum self tours, allows us to interact with satnav systems, gives instructions to workers without their having to leave the job, and drives most people around the bend when using phone menus.

The problem is that speech synthesis is a matter of tradeoffs. You can make it work well, or you can make it work fast, and sometimes neither of those alone is enough. Whatever method of speech synthesis is used to change text or machine code into speech, ideally it needs to provide naturalness and intelligibility. That is, it needs to sound as if itâ€™s coming from a human being instead of a machine, and it has to be understood by the listener.

Usage scenarios for speech synthesis
Even if you manage all this properly, thereâ€™s still the sticking point that the result is often a flat monotone or something that just doesn\'t sound right. With so much conveyed not by what is said, but how it is said, an entire dimension of meaning is lost in the speech. The synthetic voice may be perfectly understandable, but it may lack a sense of reassurance or urgency. Or it may be that the programmer put in some sort of emotion in the voice, but itâ€™s completely wrong for the situation. Who wants a cheery voice telling you that your bank account is overdrawn?

Another thing about speech synthesis is that it can go beyond putting the right emotional tone in a voice. Proper synthesis can produce speech that can be heard clearly in noisy environments, over long distances in open areas, or is more likely to catch the listenerâ€™s attention. However, to achieve any of this, it needs to go beyond simple adjustment of speed, volume, and pitch. It also needs a way of generating realistic voices without large libraries of pre-recorded speech or time-consuming algorithms.

Instead of using large libraries and manipulating synthetic speech by simply changing speed, pitch, and volume, Fujitsu took a more flexible approach by breaking down the synthesis into the basic components of speech, then setting parameters for these components, such as intonation and pauses, that can be quickly and easily manipulated so an algorithm can create speech in 1/30th the time of previous methods.

Overview of the newly-developed speech synthesis system from Fujitsu
Itâ€™s a bit like the difference between writing in Chinese characters and the Latin alphabet. Both can convey meaning, but the Latin alphabet is more flexible and uses a much less complex keyboard. For speech synthesis, the Fujitsu method uses a smaller library of speech sounds, but uses an algorithm that employs machine learning to custom tailor the voice output.

What all this means is that the Fujitsu system can adapt synthetic speech to particular circumstances. An alarm message can sound urgent, or be designed to pierce a noisy factory floor, or be heard clearly across an airfield. It can also be used to be reassuring, match the image that a company wants to present to the public, or customize an avatar\'s voice so it meets the userâ€™s preference. Fujitsu says that since the system uses only a small number of recorded speech patterns, the technology can be adapted to portable devices, such as those used in medicine, or for recreating a personâ€™s voice after its lost due to surgery or accident.

Fujitsu Laboratories says that it hopes to develop a practical version of its speech synthesis system this year.

Here is an example (wav file) showing the range of the Fujitsu speech synthesizer.

There I sat, engine running, glued to my radio enthralled by this story, my husband wondering what in the World I was doing. As a lifelong lover of words, both written and spoken, I know this is a cause that I must certainly (and literally) give MY voice to. I also do have a first hand experience with a voiceless child. My now 18 year old niece has autism and speaks only rarely. In her 18 years, I can recall hearing her utter only an occasional few words and never an entire sentence. There are thoughts there and emotions and opinions to be heard.

14769;Sara Newman;nm8trx@gmail.com;416-462-1748;Hi there. I would like to become involved as a voice donor as I have a lower woman\'s voice and can sing too. Why not add some notes? My daughter, 10 who has a great little girl voice would like to donate as well. She has the patience to do so.

In any other way I can contribute in terms of ideas, beta testing an app to voice record just drop me a note. Who is making this for you? 

As a senior character animator (I\'m on my 13th children\'s series) almost 20 years in the business, I know the importance of the right voice. It defines and adds a fullness of character that is vital. Any voice can share the opinions of the speaker, but the right voice shares the heart.

Perhaps you might like to create a PSA at some point that shows this. I may be able to find animators to help make this. No promises but I am talking you up whenever I can.

The following link is pretty illustrative of why your work is important too.

I am a speech pathologist currently undergoing a Masters of Developmental Disability at the University of Sydney. In addition to this, I am attempting to help a Non for profit organisation in NSW, Australia, called \'AAC Voice\'. We aim to be an advocacy organisation that provides individual, systemic and educational advocacy, however currently it mainly serves as a social network for people who use AAC and their supporters. I would be happy to help in other areas besides becoming a voice doner, as I think this is a great cause.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Additionally, I am an intermediate level graphic artist and if there is anything my talent can provide I would be delighted to. I have experience in sales and some experience in small scale marketing. My primary business is in financial services. I also consult small businesses in addressing their business model, business plans, sales strategies, marketing techniques, operational structure etc. I don\'t know how big this business is, but I have only worked with businesses that had less than 10 employees (mostly part-time). However, that doesn\'t necessarily mean that I am opposed to working with a larger organization. If there is anything I can help with, I\'m willing to do my best.

What a lovely idea-I hope it gets to be realised very very soon!
I am a voice artist and I have to say that I (as well) discovered you through my colleague Richard Rieman.
My native language is Greek but I can speak English very well. Please check my website www.eleanasvoices.com and if you feel I can contribute, I would be delighted to hear from you!
Otherwise, let me know if this idea expands to Greece - I can contribute there for sure!

15051;Lucas Drake;chsdrake@gmail.com;1(909)559-4331;Several years ago I received call from my Grandmother. She told me that the National Marrow Donor program had called her because they were trying to get a old of me. Many years prior I had registered with the program. Since then, I had moved a couple times and they no longer had my contact information. I was a potential match and they were trying to find me through the other contacts I had included with my form.

When I was finally able to get in touch, I went through the standard blood donation questions. When the woman on the other line learned that I was gay, there was a brief, but noticeable silence. She politely told me she would have to put me on hold and speak with her supervisor. When she returned, she apologetically told me that I was in a high risk group and they could not continue. Despite what I was feeling inside, I was polite in return and hung up the phone.

Since then, I have been invited to participate in several blood drives - about two a year at least. I used to give blood when I was a teenager. Now they serve to remind me of my isolation as a result of an antiquated screening process. As a teacher, I have to politely turn students away while somewhat hypocritically encouraging my own students to sign up.

I heard about your program on TED. It struck me as a way I could finally help someone else - quite literally with my voice. A poignant answer to being silenced years ago.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

This project is such an inspiration. Thank you! I\'m writing to see if I can help.
In addition to donating a voice, I\'m also a professional sound engineer and willing to help. 
My dear friend, Jason, suffered an aneurysm when he was just 16. A coma and months of fighting for his life left the \"old\" Jason behindâ€¦along with the use of his right limbs, speech and those other abilities we all take for granted. Your project hits close to home for me and I would love to help.

15139;John Drew;johndrew@johndrew.com;404-913-3119;As a professional voice talent for all of my adult life--I\'m now sixty-three years old--I have sought ways to contribute this gift to organizations which are working to enhance and preserve quality of life. The VOCALiD project beautifully aligns with that desire. Not that I have sought immortality, but I delight in the thought that my voice may continue to speak, albeit modified and in someone else\'s words, long after I\'ve departed this realm.

I would be honored to participate in VOCALiD.

I started to speak when I was entering college after getting my cochlear implant and I have grown so much in the journey, even though it was very tough and I still have a long way to go. 

During college, I developed and created a vibrating notification system product app with Industrial Designers and Engineers and we got it provisionally patented in which I handed to an assistive technology center. I am currently working as a designer for AT&T in-house human-centered design team in which we innovate and design many software products. I believe I am able to contribute my skills and ideas to this growing campaign. If interested, I can share my resume. Many thanks and all the best!

We were deeply moved, and I was moved to tears. I am thrilled with the idea of Vocal ID! I am a professional Contemporary Commercial Singer, and received both my Bachelors and Master Degrees in Voice Performance from Shenandoah University in Winchester, VA. My teacher, Dr. Jannette Ogg, established the Jannette E. Ogg Voice Research Center at Shenandoah Conservatory, making it the fifth university voice research facility in the United States and the first on the East Coast. The concept of Vocal ID is incredibly moving and inspiring to me, and I am very much interesting in becoming a Voice Donor!;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL

I\'ve even considered contacting the university office that oversees services for people with special needs on campus to see if they\'d be interested in partnering to host a voice drive.

He has a brother two year\'s younger who could be his donor. Are you planning to offer families the opportunity to purchase a \'voice\' using a sibling donor and if so, would the voice be compatible with apple products such as IPads?

15566;Daniel Martinez;isearthman@gmail.com;3238033201;Hello, my name is Daniel Martinez, currently a student of Cerritos College in southern California. I recently found out about this organization by listening to a TED radio hour special. While I do not personally know anybody who has suffered from a voice impairment, there was something about that segment that struck a chord with me and I would feel privileged to be given the opportunity to donate my voice. 

I think that one of the best ways to launch a successful and far reaching campaign would be to partner with universities and colleges around the US, and other countries, and the clubs that are found on those campuses; just like the Red Cross does with blood donations, but with voices, 

If the opportunity arises, I would love to be able to contribute my time in order to help in anyway possible to further this organization\'s cause. Thank you, and good luck.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;24;CALIFORNIA- CA

1) for the physical characteristics of what is left to be used to model a sound producing mechanism
2) to ask the individuals to make choices about sound producing characteristics that they find pleasing or consistent with their personality.

15759;David Zack;jeephead@gmail.com;5188329565;I was listening to \"This American Life\" podcast and was shocked that the same voice was used for anyone in need of vocal assistance. It is great that there is a device to help them communicate but how impersonal to sound the same, with no regard to age or gender. What you are doing is amazing! I want to help in anyway I can. If my voice can be used to give someone more of an identity while trying to communicate with the rest of the very different sounding world, then sign me up. I may even be able to talk my girl friend into it as well. She has such a sweet and gentle voice. I was touched to hear how excited that little girl was to have a voice of her own. Let us know how we can help.

15781;Kenneth;KennethAKeene@gmail.com;;As mentioned in the FAQ\'s section for vocal donation an app would be very benificial. I also would like to suggest the idea of using video game platforms to record vocals. I am not trying to suggest something far-fetched and intrusive like recording all vocals from online conversations, but rather setting up a version of the app on gaming platforms. Most video games whether they are PC, Mac, or console based utilize fairly high quality voice communication for online play. If the option were to be present for gamers to log some time donating their voice while they are playing games that would not otherwise require communication it could result in a vast amount of contributions. This could be set up using a reward system that would cost virtually nothing. The rewards could simply be online \"Achievements\" such as the \"Trophy\" system on Playstion and \"Gamer Score\" System on X-Box Live. Players would have the incentive to donate and for every set amount of time contributed could unlock these points. I know this project is still in development, and I hope that this is just one suggestion in thousands, but I would like to see this project succeed and don\'t have the skills help in any of the major areas.;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;English;;23;US United States

15857;Daniel Epstein;Daniel@summit.co.il;00972547222319;Beautiful TED talk by Rupal Patel. I would be honoured to donate my voice to the databank. I am a 41 year old father of four, a Rabbi and a cantor and I believe that communication is the underpinning of everything we are in this life, and beyond. To enable someone else to impart their being to another through the gift of speech mimics the ultimate and primary source of creation itself. God didn\'t create the universe. He spoke it into being. If we are all created in God\'s image, then our definitive gift back to him must be speech itself. And the use of our creativity through science to push the boundaries of possibility and to embetter the lives of our fellows must be why we are all here. Looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely yours, Daniel Epstein.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;41;UK United Kingdom

15860;Dawnn Leary;dddleary@yahoo.com;202-841-1015;So I am a voice over artist and have a mini studio with recording equipment. I use audacity to record. I am interesting in being a donor. I had a question as to the text that you would want recorded. Would you provide that text or would the voice donor have to come up with the text? I think you should reach out to VO community (and if you have that\'s great) just because in this day and age for those of us who are newbies in the business or experienced in the business you have to have a home studio with the ability to produce quality recordings. It is also encouraged to give back in the VO community and I think in addition to the every day person you would have a cadre of possible donors. I also think you should reach out to volunteer organizations like AIRS LA or Learning Ally. These are nonprofit organizations where they have individuals volunteer to read either text books or magazines for the blind, dyslexic or print impaired listeners. Not sure what the partnership could be but it could be a source for voice donors. Just a thought.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;39;DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA- DC

My name is Chen, I am a speech therapist and an audiologist (In Israel, unlike the rest of the world, you have to study both professions in the same degree). 
I have heard the TED lecture and not only was I impressed of the idea, I was quite excited about it. 
I would like to donate my voice, but I also would like to offer my self for any other help needed. I can help with research and professional knowledge. I also have some experience in technological entrepreneurship, and perhaps i can be of assistance. 
Just so you\'ll know, I posted the Ted lecture on the Israeli Facebook group of speech therapists, and I hope it will help you get some progress and support from as many people as possible.â€¬;Voice Donor Speech-Language Pathologist Other;1;0;1;0;1;0;Hebrew;English;29;IL Israel

15933;Sara Rue Avery;Rue_@live.com;6028268656;I believe vocal distinction is essential for everyone. Essential!

I consider my own voice and vocal capabilities to be distinct, clearly anunciated, versatile, and unique. I linguistically influenced by all accents because language is my forte, among others , and truly believe my voice as a donor for vocal development would help generate a unique base for those in need of vocal assistance. I am also very capable of altering my tone and annunciation in a situation when slight alteration for the desired result in meeting a recipient\'s needs. 

My mother was raised in Montana, so some of my vowel pronunciation can be unusual. People have suspected I am from other regions ( east coast? New York? Argentina? Canada? Texas?) which adds to my uniqueness. Easy to work with, a laboratory research specialist with lots of flare, I am competent and easy to work with if a proactive donor role is sought. Good cause, good vibes, good work.

Nonprofit work is in line with some of my life work which is why financial support is a factor in my ability contribute further.( I did not select it to avoid automated solicitations- no offense ;)

I am very open minded to contributing however may be seen fit! Cheers;Voice Donor Other;1;0;0;0;1;0;English;Spanish;28;ARIZONA- AZ

My professor told us about this wonderful website just a few days ago and I wanted to help any way that I could. Unfortunately, I am not an SLP so I cant assist with my expertise (yet) and I am only moderately skilled with computer programing, again no help to you all there either. Additionally I am cramming all my money into savings hoping it will be enough to keep the lights on and the mortgage paid while in Grad school, so I cant give money to this worthy cause. Truly a shame I have the will, just not the way. That leaves my voice and I will be happy to donate it as time allows me between studying and work....oh and sleep, I do that occasionally also.

16112;Elaine Sedenberg;elaine@ischool.berkeley.edu;512-653-0820;Hi! I used to volunteer for individuals with disabilities (physical and intellectual) so I was particularly moved by your project. I am a current PhD student at Berkeley in the School of Information and I specialize in issues in data policy and open science. I\'d be curious if you\'ve run into any issues (regulatory, ethical, etc) in collecting people\'s voice data and how you use (or don\'t use) these data with other attributes about each donor. This is the first repository I\'ve come across for voice data, which makes your initiative particularly unique. If you have any policy questions or unresolved issues, I\'d love to talk to you about them.

My coding skills are limited, but I would be happy to circulate any coding needs or app wishlists to my fellow I School students and see if any of them want to pursue this as a class project next fall.

16188;Laurie Anne Walden;la.walden@yahoo.com;;Hi, I heard about your project on a TED talk. I have a Southern accent (Carolinas) and would be pleased to donate my voice for your use. I also wanted to let you know about a resource that might be helpful for you. Librivox.org is a website where volunteers make audio recordings of public domain literature. I have been an admin there for several years. Once you\'re ready to actively recruit voice donors, the Librivox forum might be an excellent place to post an announcement. On the forum are readers from around the world who are already interested in making free public domain recordings -- in other words, donating their voices to a good cause -- and most already have home recording equipment and experience with audio software (most of us use Audacity). The forum language is English, but we have native speakers of many languages. We also have many thousands of hours of completed audio recordings, and our most experienced readers have hundreds of hours of recordings of their own voices already available. All Librivox recordings are in the public domain and free for any use, and I think I speak for all of us when I say that we would be thrilled if you could use them for this project. However, since our source texts are often quite old, the sentence structure and vocabulary of our existing recordings might not suit your purpose. (If you want to try to use existing recordings, I recommend that you look in our catalog for 20th-century authors like F. Scott Fitzgerald.) If you want to post about your project at Librivox, the forum link is here: https://forum.librivox.org/ . Your project would belong in the Volunteers Wanted: Other Projects forum. I would be pleased to post about it for you if you prefer not to sign up for the forum; just let me know when you are ready for volunteers. And one last note: many Librivox readers spend around 3x the finished recording time on editing (removing stumbles and mistakes), so a 2-3 hr final recording would take a few weeks for someone doing it in their spare time after work. If you are able to reduce the time, you may be able to find more voice donors. I can manage a maximum of 45 min of recording at one sitting (this would yield about 30 min of finished recording after editing). 20-30 min of continuous recording is better for my attention span and my voice. -- Thank you and good luck with your project!;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;45;NORTH CAROLINA- NC

I work for IBM\'s Emerging Technology Services Group in the UK, at their development sight Hursley nr Winchester. Each summer we run an Intern program, with teams developing solutions helped by mentors ( like myself). Last year my team developer a solution called \'Voice Bank\' which allowed a person to upload their voice ( may be before an operation ), and then re-use that voice on a mobile android platform. The mobile platform then would speak ( in the users own voice), text that the user had entered. There was also more advanced features added to the mobile device. 
A person could also donate their voice to the voice bank for people who had already lost their voice due to illness. 
Sound familiar !!
Can send you a video of the solution if interested.;Other;0;0;0;0;1;0;English;;50+;UK United Kingdom

16354;Shannon Wall;Babs829@yahoo.com;352-359-3347;I heard an interview on TED radio about this program. I cannot donate financially, but I have a voice. The time it takes to record would be time well spent to give someone the ability to have their own voice. I am unsure if you hold events or have clinics in FL, I would volunteer my time in this capacity as well. Phone is the best way to reach me, email can be fickle with all the junk filters.

16355;HÃ©lÃ¨ne Tauriac;helene.tauriac@hotmail.fr;;I knew your program through a French newspaper (Courrier International), though I don\'t think many people heard about this project here in France. That\'s a shame because I find it very interesting and original. I am sure you\'ll find everything you need to carry it out.
I have many ideas for you, but I guess you already though about them. You could make a translate version for your website, if you wish the project to be international. Regarding the recording studio, It might be possible to ask for professionals\' help in big cities, or even to use a truck/lorry (as they do for blood donation).
I know some celebrities contribute to NGOs for their advertising. If you plan to do the same, it might be a good idea to be in touch with singers or musicians: they have experience with studios and should be sensible to your project. I play in a music band myself and had the chance to record some tracks.
I also have a question for you, it might be a dumb one, but I was wondering how can someone lose his voice. 
Hope we will hear about you again in France! See you soon

In this work I trained group leaders around the country and in Romania, Kiev and India. I was advised by friends who had retired to not jump into volunteer work right away and to see what emerges. Your TED Talk is the first thing I\'ve found that is absolutely inspiring. I would definitely like to volunteer my voice and wonder if there may be other ways I can help...if not financially. The idea of helping people to speak in their own voices is powerful and I so appreciate the work you are doing.

I am interested in being a voice donor. I was thrilled to find out about your project on TED via NPR. It is a pleasure for me to read aloud. I have a background in speech pathology, though not a speech pathologist. During college I recorded books for students with disabilities. I speak with a standard American dialect. I currently narrate web-based trainings for my employer. Please feel free to contact me.

16550;Andrea;a.hahn_bln@online.de;;An exciting project! I have occasionally wondered why something that exists for impersonal information like airport announcements could not be put to use to help people maintain or recreate such an important aspect of identity. Unfortunately I do not have any specialist skills to contribute, just an interest in languages and acoustics, but would be very happy to join in as a voice donor, once that \"distributed recording\" phase takes off!

Just a question: apart from mobile applications and games, would it also be worth looking into website-based crowdsourcing options? So far, the projects at https://www.zooniverse.org/ center around transcriptions or tagging of digitally available information, but the people behind that are quite an enthusiastic bunch and rather inventive in trying to make it interesting for contributors. They also seem to be continuously extending their spectrum of projects, so that I could imagine they might be interested.;;0;0;0;0;0;0;;;;

I am willing to be a Voice Donor.
I read your FAQ; two points I wish to focus on:
1) If you do have a recording studio or access to one, thatâ€™s fantastic!
2) All weâ€™d ask is that you record in a quiet place.

In my opinion, my environment has much background noise; Like, the hum on my computer, the refrigerator self defrost cycles, the exterior main road traffic, the neighbors occasional television bought, AND the ever sporadic volunteer Fire Siren that is volumed to be heard for 5 PLUS miles away (it is just a Block away from me).

I do not have a Cell phone, only a Land line.

It has been a good many years since I was in College (Early 70â€™s); but,
The Music Departments had soundproof rooms for the students to Practice in, which were open for the use, for as long as was needed. Just find an empty room and move in â€“ no overnights.
Also:
The Audio Visual Department had recording equipment to loan out to students with their ID Cards (Students had to provide their own CASSETTES, 8-TRACKS, or REAL to REELs :-)

There is a College 30 Miles away from me: Geneseo University.
Although I am still waiting for a Callback from them, IF THEY WOULD ALLOW ME, to use their facilities, I can spend an 8-hour day there and record my voice for you.

I may need some kind of confirmation from you to use their equipment as a NON STUDENT.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;61;NEW YORK- NY

I work at an expeditionary learning charter school in Baltimore, and this would be a great authentic project to motivate students to practice reading with fluency and could add quite a few teen & preteen voices to your bank.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;41;MARYLAND- MD
16756;Gonzalo FernÃ¡ndez de CÃ³rdoba;gfernandez@shackletongroup.com;0034619021786;Hello,
 
We write from Shackleton Group because a couple of weeks ago we discovered VocalID and we found it as a very exciting project. From the very first moment we saw in it clear synergies with one of our best clients, a multinational company in telecommunications sector, which might be interested in contributing in points 2 and 3 of VocalID website: Technical expertise donor and Business expertise donor. Actually in all 3 points, because if the impact of the project is increased, it will be easier to get voice donors.
 
We think we can provide technical expertise and business expertise both in the process of voice donating as well as voice creation, but obviously our knowledge about VocalID is very limited and only you know what are really your needs and what aspects you would like us to contribute.
 
Our client doesnâ€™t know anything yet about this, and we want to make a viable proposal and that make sense both for you and for them. For this reason, we need to know if you think there may be ways of collaboration. If so, be kind to contact us in order to learn a little more of VocalID and those specific areas where you would like us to contribute.
 
Thanks in advance and congratulations for VocalID.

16759;William H. Cook II;willcook2@gmail.com;;I am a redheaded male. I picked up accent traits from Texas, Tennessee, Florida and Ohio, and believe it is mainly unique. I\'m soft spoken, and I believe I sound more youthful than my years. At my disposal I have a Soundblaster sound card on my desktop computer with a Crystal Voice microphone, a quiet environment, and if need be, I can record my speech in WAV or other lossless format or any format you would like and send it to you. I am extremely accommodating, so any way I can help in contributing my voice at this stage of your project, just let me know.;Voice Donor ;1;0;0;0;0;0;English;;39;FLORIDA- FL
